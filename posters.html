<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Functional safety is a crucial consideration in the development of road vehicles. Microcontrollers (MCUs) that operate in high-safety automotive systems typically incorporate lockstep mechanisms to detect errors and enhance safety. In this study, we introduce Falcon, a dual-core lockstep automotive MCU that utilizes the RISC-V ISA. Falcon employs a lightweight, off-core-level Sphere of Replication (SoR) that necessitates minimal modifications to the original microarchitecture. It assesses certain critical signals of the primary and checker cores to identify possible soft errors while avoiding potential spatial-temporal coupling failures. The main core supports RV32IMAFDC with 6 execution units and is compatible with AHB/AXI interfaces. Falcon also incorporates an interrupt controller. This study demonstrates that RISC-V ISA-based MCUs can have a wide-ranging application space in the high-safety automotive processor field.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>In recent years we are witnessing an increasing adoption of RISC-V based systems to run Artificial Intelligence (AI) inference tasks. This trend spans to visual navigation, where major players start adopting RISC-V for autonomous driving. Still, RISC-V based edge devices fall short in providing the performance requirements of complex AI inference. Our work tackles the previous challenges by proposing an opensource framework for transparent distribution of visual navigation inference tasks between edge and cloud for resource-constrained RISC-V edge devices. Our framework automates the partitioning of ONNX and TFLite models between a RISC-V accelerated nanodrone equipped a GAP8 system-on-chip and a cloud server. Our results showcase how partial inference improves the performance achieve by drone-only inference.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Passthrough devices is the default option for high-performance I/O for virtual machines. However, a virtual machine cannot efficiently nor transparently take advantage of a virtual IOMMU to manage device assigned to it, due to the fact that existing solutions for virtual IOMMU is based on emulation or paravirtualization. This extended abstract describes a hardware-assisted design for providing efficient and transparent virtual IOMMU for virtual machines.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>The Em programming language elevates embedded firmware development to a higher-level which has historically eluded C. Originally conceived in the 2009-2010 timeframe, Em has evolved over the last decade through a series of commercial deployments in low-power, low-cost wireless IoT applications. Thanks to novel optimization techniques employed by the underlying language translator, Em programs would invariably out-perform their hand-crafted C counterparts in terms of time and (especially) space. Initial engagement with RISC-V began last year through Em support for two development boards used for edge-processing. With tenfold reductions in program footprint not uncommon, opportunities abound to target small RISC-V MCUs and SoCs with less than 32K of memory – pushing conventional edge-processing designs to the IoT fringe in terms of silicon size and power consumption.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>We present our BLIS-like general matrix multiplication ( gemm) for the multicore RISC-V processor embedded in the GAP8 platform, and evaluate the parallel performance of this computational kernel in a deep learning (DL) scenario. Concretely, we leverage the IM2COL approach to transform the convolution layers into gemm, and develop a parallelized algorithm tailored for this ultra-low-power processor, targeting DL inference with a MobileNet-v1 convolutional model. Our experimental results demonstrate that the gemm algorithm achieves a significant speed-up compared to the sequential version. This work thus contributes to the development of high-performance and energy-efficient machine-learning applications for multicore RISC-V processors.</p>

<p><em>Location: #7 MR07-08.</em></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>The complexity of computation logic in embedded vision applications is on the rise due to increase in video resolutions and image quality requirements. There are many frameworks that support acceleration of embedded vision applications, such as OpenVXTM [1]. It is a royalty-free cross platform framework using connected graph representation of operations In OpenVXTM, image operations are expressed as graph of nodes, where nodes can be run on hardware or software. Typically, the run functions of the computationally complex nodes can be optimized in specialized hardware logic like FPGA to achieve acceleration and thus better FPS (frame per second). The graph is represented in C/C++ and is hosted on OS like Linux. This paper explains the acceleration of 2D convolution as OpenVXTM run functions using a Generic Matrix Multiplier (GMM) implemented in FPGA logic and summarizes the benefits of the proposed architecture by comparing the execution times and frame rates with and without FPGA acceleration.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Hardware-centric courses at Computer Science and Engineering degrees benet from using a HW-based approach following an actual computer ISA and an autonomous lab setup for practical sessions. Prior teaching experiences using proprietary ISAs have shown the success of our methodology. However, the RISC-V architecture is an appealing alternative due to its open nature and potential for pervasiveness. This work explores the path towards using RISC-V architecture in the courses and the HW and SW needs that need to be adresssed.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Aerospace industry requirements for SoC design demand high reliability and fault tolerance techniques while maintaining high standard performance in harsh environments and autonomous complex applications. The emergence of RISC-V architectures and toolsets offers a new paradigm for ASIC design, promising to accelerate and facilitate the design, verification, and testing of ASICs, reducing design time and costs. This work aims to demonstrate the feasibility of designing safe and secure architectures under the umbrella of open-source tools based on RISC-V. The safety and security constraints are analysed from three perspectives: hardware solutions and architecture definition at design level, the introduction of external IPs in the design with redundant techniques, and fault detection and mitigation techniques from external factors. The results indicate that RISC-V-based tools can be utilized to develop reliable and secure aerospace systems.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Fault Tolerance represents an important area for digital applications, so it has received recent acceleration in its development and evolution. Being able to understand how to protect electronic circuits, and in particular microprocessors, from the different types of SEE (Single Event Error) faults, frequent and internally divisible into other categories, is a very complex process [1], which sees the study and consequent implementation of these techniques for the hardware/software protection of the architectures under examination, making them more expensive and less performing than the respective non-redundant architectures. Safety and Reliability are, therefore, two key concepts in the technological world, and RISC-V plays an interesting role in this context for its inherent extendability and the availability of open-source microarchitecture designs.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Transient Execution Side Channels in modern hardware systems are particularly hard to detect and even harder to mitigate efficiently. Our case study on the open-source out-of-order processor SonicBOOM highlights some of the difficulties and pitfalls involved. We detected that a vulnerability to Meltdown has been re-introduced to the design by minor hardware updates and that closing this gap can easily leave certain channels open or even introduce new ones, e.g., channels that are based on speculative interference. Furthermore, we show how these channels can securely be mitigated with the help of a formal verification tool.</p>

<p><em>Location: #12 MR05-06.</em> <em>Link: <a href="media/proceedings/posters/2023-06-06-Raúl-DE-LA-CRUZ-abstract.pdf">extended abstract</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>More integrated systems come at the price of harder predictability and determinism. This is specially true on MPSoCs with myriad shared resources that can behave as interference channels thus creating contention and nondeterministic behaviour. Variability makes MPSoCs very hard and expensive to certify for safety-critical systems. In order to ease the certification process and guarantee tasks’ timeliness, drastic measures are traditionally enforced in the system configuration. Some of these include the deactivation of resources to avoid contention scenarios, synchronization of core’s partitions using ARINC-653 schedulers and long provisioning of budget times increasing deadlines. These mitigation strategies impact drastically on the performance of the system, either underutilizing most of the advanced MPSoCs capabilities or reducing the integration level of mixed-criticality applications. This work proposes novel QoS strategies to enforce determinism of mixed-criticality applications while performance is preserved.

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>In this paper, we present the application of fault injection simulations to identify and selectively harden the most ciritical flip-flops of RISC-V microprocessors. The critical flip-flops are obtained by calculating the Architectural Vulnerability Factor (AVF) using several different processor workloads upon injection of Single-Event-Upset (SEU) faults. The impact of selective hardening on the RISC-V cores is assessed by comparing power, performance and area (PPA) metrics.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>When people talk about platform security, memory isolation is considered a key fundamental. In a RISC-V-based platform, there are a couple of mechanisms inside a hart to perform physical memory isolation, such as PMP, ePMP, sPMP, etc. They are used to control the access from the CPU itself. Other than CPU, I/O agents’ accesses are controlled by IOPMP. IOPMP is a checker with a set of ordered rules. Checking an access can be time-consuming because the check may not finish in one cycle, and sometimes more than one access is needed for one check. This creates a problem for latency-sensitive systems. This document will introduce two features to mitigate this problem, which were discussed in the RISC-V IOPMP Task Group. We will first introduce the latency reduction in respect of the downstream devices of an IOPMP, and then we will discuss the cooperation between IOPMP and its upstream prefetcher.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>In this paper, we present the Memory Authenticated Encryption Engine (MAEE) hardware countermeasure to ensure the confidentiality and authenticity of data in RAM and the associated interconnect bus. Using the Subterranean 2.0 authenticated encryption algorithm, data used by a processor is secured at the output of cache memory, and stored in memory as chunks, containing encrypted data and metadata for authenticity verification. The MAEE provides protection against attacks targeting the memory and its bus, such as Rowhammer, fault injections or side-channel attacks. We are also evaluating the performance of this countermeasure, by associating it with the RISC-V CVA6 application core.</p>

<p>This work presents the design and validation of a compact and efficient RO-PUF/TRNG module, which combines ID generation and entropy source functionalities, and can be used as an essential primitive of a hardware RoT for RISC-V based SoCs. The design was encapusalted as an IP core to provide it with a high level of configurability, flexibility, and reusability. A comprehensive SDK for online characterization, validation, and performance monitoring of PUF and TRNG quality metrics was also developed.

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Safety-critical systems such as those in automotive, avionics and space, require appropriate safety measures to avoid silent data corruption upon random hardware errors such as those caused by radiation and other types of electromagnetic interference. Those safety measures must be able to prevent faults from causing the so-called common cause failures (CCFs), which occur when a fault produces identical errors in redundant elements so that comparison fails to detect the errors and a failure arises. The usual solution to avoid CCFs in CPU cores is using lockstep cores, so that two cores execute the same flow of instructions, but with some time staggering so that their state is never identical and faults can only lead to different errors, which are then detectable by means of comparison. This paper extends Gaisler’s RISC-V NOEL-V core with lockstep; and presents future prospects for its use and distribution.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Safety-critical domains, such as automotive, space, and robotics, are adopting increasingly powerful multicores with abundant hardware shared resources for higher performance and efficiency. However, mutual interference due to parallel operation within the SoC must be properly validated. Recently, the SafeTI traffic injector has been released and integrated in a homogeneous RISC-V multicore for testing, otherwise untestable casuistic for software-only solutions. This paper introduces some enhancements performed on the SafeTI, which include internal pipelining for higher-rate traffic injection, and its tailoring to multiple interfaces, as well as its integration in a more powerful heterogeneous RISC-V multicore based on Gaisler’s technology for the space domain.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>RISC-V adoption is rapidly expanding even to safety-critical application areas, such as automotive, space, robotics, and health-care. In these areas, it is crucial to guarantee that the probability of a critical failure stemming from a permanent hardware fault falls below a given threshold, often following the guidelines and rules of standards and regulations. In this scenario, possible solutions must combine functional safety goals with constraints related for example to the hardware and performance overhead, the flexibility, the ease of adoption. In the last decade, Self-Test Libraries (STLs) became a commonly adopted solution widely supported by semiconductor, IP and EDA companies, allowing system companies to deploy effective in-field test mechanisms able to detect a high percentage of permanent hardware faults arising during the operational phase (e.g., due to aging). This paper summarizes the latest advancements in the area of STLs for RISC-V architectures, emphasizing the advantages stemming under this perspective from the open instruction set architecture.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Hardware/Software co-designs offer a promising way to support different Post-quantum cryptographic algorithms on one platform. Especially, as these algorithms are not yet standardized, the flexibility of such an approach is important to support possible future algorithm changes in the standardization process. To explore the design space of such RISC-V based HW/SW co-designs, we present three different ASICs, designed since 2020, accelerating different subsets of the PQ-algorithms in the NIST competition, one in UMC 65nm and two in Globalfoundries‘ 22nm. All designs offer significant performance advantages over pure software implementations on the same platform, while largely maintaining the flexibility of a pure software approach.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>This paper presents a procedure for implementing simulation-based fault injection on the Ibex core with its UVM testbench. The simulation aims to identify the critical flip-flops where faults could lead to erroneous system operation. We first select testcases for the simulation, based on their contributions to functional coverages. Then the simulation is conducted at the RTL. For each testcase, we remove the identified critical flip-flops from its fault list to reduce the number of faults we need to inject. The identified critical flip-flops are mapped from RTL to the gate level eventually. The procedure could reduce the time required by fault injection to some extent.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>As transistor scaling continues to reach the deep nanometer range, modern systems face increasing challenges in ensuring reliability, particularly in safety- and mission-critical applications. Concurrently, the agile hardware development methods are gaining traction over the conventional waterfall approach in reducing hardware development costs. Therefore, investigating the intersection of highly reliable system design and agile hardware development processes is crucial. In this paper, we propose an iterative agile hardening strategy that integrates fault injection, reliability analysis, and hardening method selection. The proposed approach enables quick deployment of appropriate hardening methods and avoids over- or under-protection of the target system. Our goal is to achieve fine-grained high-reliability hardware development at a high abstraction level while balancing the trade-off between reliability, time-to-market, performance, and other important factors.</p>

<p>CROSSCON is a 3-year, multi-million euro, Research and Innovation Action funded under Horizon Europe. The project aims to design a new open, modular, highly portable, and vendor-independent IoT security stack that can run on various devices using heterogeneous hardware architectures, including RISC-V. The Consortium sees in RISC-V a two-fold opportunity. Firstly, by aiming to develop an interoperable reference security stack, we believe we can contribute to the expected specifications of ongoing initiatives for Trusted Execution and Confidential Computing on Application processors (i.e., CoVE) and microcontrollers. Secondly, RISC-V offers a unique opportunity to develop novel security hardware extensions for software services, either by creating extensions directly to the ISA or developing non-ISA hardware mechanisms that support the efficient implementation of security guarantees at the application level.</p>

This is achieved through the automatic and very fine-grained adaptation of highly generic components to the application. The Scale4Edge ecosystem covers highly scalable components and tools and extends them for application-specific edge components at three levels: (1) CPU instruction level defined by the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), (2) software level defined by the C programming language standard C11 with compilers and libraries open to complementary standards like MISRA-C, and (3) operating system and firmware level through system services, configuration interfaces, and drivers.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>In this talk, we will present the newly EU-funded project AERO (Accelerated EU Cloud) whose mission is to bring up and optimize the software stack of cloud deployments on top of the EU processor. After providing an overview of the AERO project, we will expand on two main components of the software stack to enable seamless acceleration of various programming languages on RISC-V architectures; namely, ComputeAorta which enables the generation of RISC-V vector instructions from SPIR-V binary modules, and TornadoVM which enables transparent hardware acceleration of managed applications. Finally, we will describe how the ongoing integration of ComputeAorta and TornadoVM will enable a plethora of applications from managed languages to harness RISC-V auto-vectorization completely transparently to developers.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Succesfully designing a well-balanced general purpose processor targeting an ASIC implementation is an arduous task. As a result, software timing models are generally developped to enable fast design space exploration in the pathfinding phase. Those models are later tightly correlated to RTL as it becomes available, but can still provide valuable insight late in the design phase as they can simulate large workloads and provide non-intrusive access to internal information. In this paper, we leverage the gem5 timing simulator infrastructure to provide a fast timing simulation environment to drive microarchitectural improvements for the risc-v CVA6 processor. We also depict a correlation flow to ensure that the timing performance model keeps projecting meaningful performance numbers.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>We explore whether already compiled RISC-V binaries can be selectively turned into hardware. From a list of function symbols selected by the designer, Iron automatically generates a hardware design consisting of a SOC and RISC-V CPU, together with co-processors synthesized from the selected functions machine code. Whenever the CPU reaches the address of one of these functions, the corresponding co-processor executes instead. This makes the change from the software to the hardware versions completely seamless, enabling client-side hardware acceleration, possibly depending on available hardware resources (e.g. various FPGAs). RISC-V is particularly well suited to this endeavor thanks to its wide adoption, reduced instruction set, many registers and clean open-source ISA. We discuss a proof of concept, the encountered challenges and the excitingvenues for future work. Iron is an open-source software.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>The RISC-V architecture was created to cover a wide range of applications. With a good base integer set, optional standard extensions and a defined approach to custom instructions the RISC-V ISA is well equipped to handle an enormous variety of computational tasks. To date, the majority of the R &amp; D effort into RISC-V cores has been focused on essentially replacing well known cores from legacy proprietary architectures. With semiconductor scaling slowing if not failing, the main way to achieve improved performance efficiently is with architectural innovation. A wide range of specialized applications is well-suited to the RISC-V ISA but require specialized processor cores. To meet ongoing demands a larger number of custom processor cores are needed but there are a limited number of processor design engineers. This demand can be met by both reducing the design cycle through processor design automation technology and by using existing RISC-V processor cores as a starting point for customization.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>RISC-V-based Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) are witnessing a steady rise in adoption in both industry and academia. However, the limited support for Linux-capable Full System-level simulators hampers development of the RISC-V ecosystem. We address this by validating a full system-level simulator, gXR5 (gem5-eXtensions for RISC-V), against the SiFive HiFive Unleashed SoC, to ensure performance statistics are representative of actual hardware. This work also enriches existing methodologies to validate the gXR5 simulator against hardware by proposing a systematic component-level calibration approach. The simulator error for selected SPEC CPU2017 applications reduces from 44% to 24%, just by calibrating the CPU. We show that this systematic component-level calibration approach is accurate, fast (in terms of simulation time), and generic enough to drive future validation efforts.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>HPC applications are demanding more specialized accelerators to tackle with their increasing complexity, and requirements. This context, together with the fact that Europe is promoting the use of the open source RISC-V ISA, brings the opportunity of exploring the design space for specific working scenarios. For research and exploration purposes, OpenPiton could be a well-suited framework for future manycore accelerators designs, although there are several areas that should be improved to achieve HPC performance. This paper presents an extension of the OpenPiton framework towards the HPC domain, starting from modifying the computational elements, the Tiles. In addition, this paper extends the SystemVerilog verification environment, but also the FPGA implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>High Performance Computing (HPC) supercomputers are composed of up to ten thousand nodes, each one having hundreds of cores organized around a shared memory. These nodes communicate through a high-performance communication network. Applications for HPC have increasing needs, both in terms of computational speed and the size of datasets to be processed. To follow these needs, memory in supercomputers is increasing at a rate such that, in the next decade, it will likely exceed 264 bytes. The RISC-V 128-bit ISA gives us the opportunity to rethink how memory is addressed and virtualized at the scale of a supercomputer. We are working on a platform to simulate a distributed 128-bit system with a global address space shared by the whole supercomputer.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>The number of available RISC-V cores is growing rapidly and the openness of RISC-V enabled even smaller teams to develop their own cores. However, the wide variety of RISC-V cores available today and the high modularity of the ISA makes it hard for development tools to keep up with the speed of development, as well as to provide first class support for this growing ecosystem. In this paper, we present a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for defining processor pipelines. With just a few lines of code in this DSL, information about RISC-V pipelines can be collected from simulation waveforms for further processing. As one application of this DSL, we present a web application that functions as a pipeline rendering backend, helpful for debugging and design understanding.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>In this paper, we present a flexible simulation environment, well-suited for rapid prototyping of RISC-V embedded software. The environment supports both purely functional and performance simulations. It is based on an open-source instruction set simulator (ISS), called ETISS, which features a plugin mechanism to easily extend its functionality. This allows, for instance, to retrieve and modify the simulator state, enabling an early evaluation of the chosen processor architecture. Our approach utilizes this extensibility to automatically generate behavioral models for ETISS, based on abstract instruction set architecture (ISA) descriptions. This enables a quick adaptation of ETISS to an ISA variant, and eases the integration of our approach into existing design flows, e.g., to generate and validate custom RISC-V cores. We also outline how to extend ETISS to work as a performance estimator, using abstract descriptions of the targeted microarchitectures.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Open-source silicon has the potential to reduce the blind-trust risk in integrated circuits (ICs) and enable reuse and collaboration on high-quality, thoroughly verified, interoperable IC blocks. RISC-V as an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) is a key enabler for open-source silicon. The RISC-V ISA and an open-source RISC-V core alone are not sufficient to form an open-source silicon ecosystem, however: other IC blocks, such as on-chip interconnects and off-chip interfaces adhering to industry standards, are also required. While there is open-source design code for some of these blocks, practically none of them come with verification code, which is crucial for commercial silicon. The Silicon Commons is an open-source silicon ecosystem that contains design and verification code of IC blocks that form a full chip framework. The Silicon Commons also standardizes technical and organizational processes that enable multiple organizations to collaboratively engineer silicon and software that serves their mutual interests. The Silicon Commons is actively applied in the OpenTitan project.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>This work describes the design and implementation of an open-source IOMMU IP compliant with the ratified version of the RISC-V IOMMU specification (v1.0-rc1). So far, we have designed and implemented a basic IP encompassing only the mandatory features (of the spec) and support for virtualization. which has been successfully validated and evaluated on a single-core CVA6-based SoC. Moving forward, we plan to extend the IP with more advanced features, i.e., optional features such as a hardware performance monitor, memory-resident interrupt files support, etc. We will open-source our IP to the RISC-V community.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become the most popular platform for accelerating modern applications such as Machine Learning, Signal Processing, and Graph workloads. Modern GPUs use Single Instruction, Multiple Thread (SIMT) structures to schedule several Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) pipelines, thus maximizing Data Level Parallelism. In this work, we propose Ventus, a General Purpose GPU (GPGPU) implementation based on the RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV). Lanes in the warps of Ventus are organized as a vector-thread architecture. We add self-defined instructions, such as branch, register index extension and Tensor Core related instructions to fulfill the functional requirements of a GPGPU. We accomplish a complete OpenCL to RVV compiler and driver that fit our hardware design. Ventus is successfully deployed on an FPGA-based platform and scales up to 16 SMs with a total of 256 warps. This work is developed in Chisel HDL and is now open-sourced on Github.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>A RISC-V processor design is usually expected to be clocked at most at 300MHz on the latest high-end FPGAs, 100MHz being a reasonable average guess. One day I opened up a data sheet and read that Intel’s Stratix 10 routing fabric can be clocked at 1GHz. This is one order of magnitude higher, but can we reach such a high frequency, and if not, what is the practical limit? As I set out to explore how fast and resource-efficient a RISC-V CPU can be on FPGAs, I will share a few guidelines I discovered along the way. Topics will include various strategies to make timing analysis doable for large designs, how to take advantage of hyper-registers, reducing area using BRAMs without sacrificing performance, and managing resets and other high-fanout signals.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>In this extended abstract, we present the RISC-V AMS VP framework, an evaluation platform that combines the open source RISC-V Virtual Prototype (VP) with SystemC AMS (Analog/Mixed Signal) for accurate environment modeling of heterogeneous systems. The RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), with its modular and extensible design, has garnered significant popularity in academia and industry. The growing RISC-V ecosystem includes various tools, simulators, and processor implementations for supporting the development flow. However, the integration of SystemC AMS with RISC-V VPs has not been explored thus far. The proposed RISC-V AMS VP framework provides a unified view of software, hardware, and AMS environment models, enabling design and verification engineers to accurately interact with the system at different levels and perform powerful analyses. As a case study, we created a temperature control system that integrates a sensor, heater component, and control software running on a RISC-V platform. We also briefly discuss a fault- injection evaluation, considering different modeling layers. We provide the RISC-V AMS VP framework and the temperature control system case study as open source resources, laying the foundation for further research and education in this field.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>The verification of caches is particularly challenging, as it is necessary to ensure that the memory consistency is ensured in all conditions and modern caches contain many complex features (out of order execution, write buffer, multiple request ports) and a complex micro-architecture in order to ensure high-performance. The recently released, Open-Source High Performance L1 Data Cache (HPDCache) for the RISC-V is delivered as a highly configurable RTL model, compounding the verification challenge as correct behaviour must be ensured for all combinations of the parameters. An approach combining pseudo random constraint and directed random test within the framework of Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) is used to be able to verify HPDcache.</p>

<p>This paper introduces an FPGA verification, debug and performance platform for RISC-V cores. The system utilizes the open source RISC-V simulator Spike as a golden model that can be co-emulated with the core in real time. In our experience, this enables verification at up to 50 MHz. This allows for rapid iteration of new features by testing them in a realistic environment without a previous need for unit-level verification.

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Architecture-level verification of RISC-V Vector (RVV) cores presents a complex challenge due to the diverse behavior of vector instructions under various instruction parameters and core configurations. The vector instruction test suite must be capable of addressing all legitimate combinations of vector instructions under all the different configurations to accomplish comprehensive verification targets. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of seven open-source test suites for vector ISA: Imperas, RIOS Labs, RISCV-Torture, RISCV-DV, FORCE-RISCV, Yang’s Generator and Tenstorrent. We provide an objective evaluation of the attributes and coverage of these test suites using the RVV Specification v1.0 as a reference. Our study reveals that a combination of these test generators can provide a fairly comprehensive verification strategy for vector cores. On a stand alone basis, FORCE-RISCV covers the complete RVV v1.0 specification upto a VLEN of 4096. Similarly, Imperas is fairly exhaustive but limited to VLEN of 256.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>We present TestRIG, a test framework for RISC-V implementations. To use TestRIG, a Direct Instruction Injection interface is added to the implementation under test. Direct Instruction Injection allows the test framework to inject instructions directly into the processor’s pipeline (instead of instructions being fetched from program memory). The Direct Instruction Injection approach simplifies randomized testing, particularly when the test programs contain branch instructions. We describe some of the main challenges in randomized testing of CPUs, and explain how TestRIG overcomes them. Finally, we give examples of some hardware bugs that were found using TestRIG, including bugs in the floating point library supplied with the BlueSpec compiler and bugs that were detected during development of the CHERI security extension.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>To uphold the principle of least privilege, RISC-V can further limit M mode’s access to memory through PMP enhancements in the Smepmp extension. Ibex is an open-source processor, and it uses these enchancements to be a compelling choice for security-critical applications. Because Ibex is thoroughly verified and production quality, the verification requirements are high for adding this extension. In this proposal, we design a coverage plan for Smepmp, generate sensible constrained-random Smepmp configurations and add directed tests to maximize coverage of corner cases. Smepmp poses a particular challenge because many transitions and configurations lead to immediate faults, such as when MML is enabled and the PC is not in an executable region. Through this work, we improve the overall PMP coverage with Smepmp from 63 % to 98 %.</p>

<p>On the path of creating high-quality processor IP a major challenge is the need to verify the correctness of the design across a wide range of configurations and use cases. Each configuration needs to be validated and can be challenging to ensure all possible input patterns are exercised and functions are correctly implemented. In this paper, we go through a novel approach in verifying an open-source, high-quality and customizable RISC-V core with a comprehensive methodology. We explain the importance of thorough planning, use of automated code review and exhaustive formal guided automation. We provide evidence illustrating how proposed methodology is cost-effective and highly efficient in preventing bugs to escape and accelerates sign-off process.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>RISC-V is an open and free ISA designed to be modular. It enables new business models. Increasingly, AI chips and other DSAs are adopting RISC-V. With the finalization of the RISC-V Vector extension, the industry is looking for innovative solutions to accelerate AI and HPC applications. Maintaining a wide range of hand-optimized intrinsic kernels for various AI chips is costly and difficult to scale. We believe that RVV auto-vectorization is the key technique to alleviate this burden on human resources. We have evaluated the auto-vectorization performance of our LLVM-based compiler ZCC on some popular kernels, and it shows that ZCC has an 18% better dynamic instruction count performance compared to hand-optimized kernels written in RVV built-in functions. To the best of our knowledge, ZCC is the only one that can successfully auto-vectorize both inner and outer loops by fully utilizing RVV features. ZCC has also achieved a 30% better performance (dynamic instruction count) compared to LLVM on SPECInt 2006.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>RISC-V is an instruction set architecture (ISA) that, as a core feature, can be extended with special instructions to customize embedded processors to special applications such as from the control and machine learning domain. There exist several instruction set simulators (ISS), that can quickly evaluate the benefit of special instructions for a given application. Next to the core, also the compiler and assembler support for creating a binary from embedded C code is required by designers to exploit performance benefits of special instructions such as Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) operations. We introduce a code generation tool for extending existing LLVM implementations with support for custom RISC-V instructions described in the CoreDSL format.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>We implemented and formally proved code hoisting, loop-invariant code motion (LICM) and strength reduction for RISC-V by translation validation. This approach consists in splitting the pass into an unproved transformation—called an “oracle”—and a formally proved defensive verifier. More specifically, our verifier is based on symbolic execution; a well-known general purpose validation technique that simulates the possible execution paths of the code using a symbolic representation of registers and memory. Our transformations improve on those proposed by Knoop et al. The oracle is co-designed with the verifier and logs information, such as invariants, that help the verifier check equivalence; whereas other attempts at translation validation had to reconstruct these invariants heuristically.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Modern applications are dynamic. There are many dynamicity aspects : dynamic allocation, user chosen data sets, user chosen parameters, dynamic / interpreted languages, indirect memory access, transprecision . . . RISCV-V modern processors contains also dynamic behaviour : data and instruction caches, pipelines . . . Aggressive compilers are unable to catch so many dynamic application aspects, but there is a need to adapt binary code to those two dynamic aspects because run-time behaviour contains huge optimization opportunities. RISCV-V has also a specific difficulty : since the ISA is open, there is many implementations with subtle variants : specifics accelerators, special instructions, special register banks. Those variants are difficult to handle with a monolitic compiler. HybroGen is an experimental compiler designed to build application with dynamic binary code adaptations.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>With the end of the well-established scaling, and laws, such as Dennard scaling, Amdahl’s law, or even Moore’s law, thw wider industry has started looking at possible solutions. One of the solutions that has emerged is heterogeneous compute. In its essence it solves the problem by having individual computational blocks, i.e., processors, that are specialized/customized for a certain job or workloads. Although this idea is not new and we can see an evidence of it in the past, the design of such processors has been challenging and requires not only deep technology knowledge, but also a significant amount of resources and time. In this paper, we present a novel approach to heterogeneous compute that is based on pre-verified processors that designers can further innovate using supplied EDA tools. The pre-verified processors and their control and data paths are prepared for the heterogeneous compute and therefore the knowledge and resource requirements are reduced to a minimum. The designers focus on what really matters to them instead of reinventing the wheel for the baseline of the processor or its instruction set.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Computational SRAM (C-SRAM) is a new computing solution for Near-Memory Computing. It allows to perform operations inside or next to the memory without transferring data over the system bus, leading to significantly reducing energy consuption. Operations are realized on large vectors of data occupying the entire physical row of C-SRAM array, leading to high performance gains. This paper presents the C-SRAM solution as an integrated vector-processing unit to be used by a RISC-V processor as an energy-efficient and high performing co-processor. The proposed programming model of the C-SRAM is based on the system bus of a RISC-V processor.</p>

<p>RISC-V is an emerging instruction set architecture. Its modular and extensible open-source royalty-free design is increasingly attracting interest from both research and industry. Nowadays, different RISC-V-based boards can be bought off the shelf. However, software availability is equivalently vital in guaranteeing the RISC-V ecosystem’s success. Here we contribute with the first publicly available port of PyTorch. PyTorch is one of the most popular Deep Learning libraries available today. As such, it is a crucial enabler in running state-of-the-art AI applications on RISC-V-based systems and a first step towards a fully democratic end-to-end codesign process.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>The ROOT data analysis framework is used to analyze exabytes of data in the domain of High Energy Physics (HEP). One critical ingredient is its interactive C++ interpreter Cling, powering many areas of ROOT from the IO layer to interoperability with Python. Outside of HEP, Cling is also used to provide the C++ kernel for Jupyter notebooks. The interpreter is built on top of LLVM and Clang and uses just-in-time compilation (JIT) to emit and execute native machine code. In this contribution, we describe the work required to port ROOT and Cling to the RISC-V architecture. We describe the changes needed to run a first physics analysis and put special emphasis on the particularities for supporting RISC-V’s modular ISA design.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>High-performance architectures are increasingly heterogeneous and incorporate often specialized hardware. We have first seen the generalization of GPUs in the most powerful machines, followed by FPGAs, and now by many other accelerators such as Tensor Processor Units (TPUs) for Deep Neural Networks, or variable precision FPUs. Recent hardware manufacturing trends make it very likely that specialization will not only persist, but increase. Manually managing this heterogeneity is complex and not maintainable. We therefore propose to revisit how we design both hardware and OS in order to better hide the heterogeneity. To ensure long term viability of our proposal, we propose to entertain the use of 128-bit addressing.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Sparse and irregular workloads are crucial to various data-driven applications including computational physics, graph analytics, and sparse neural networks. However, their high control overhead and irregular memory access patterns are inefficiently handled by today’s architectures, resulting in low functional unit utilization and low overall efficiency. While proposed hardware solutions accelerate irregular workloads, most are held back by a lack of generality or their large architectural impact. We present Cooperating Indexed Stream Registers, a lightweight RISC-V ISA extension building on stream registers to accelerate three key operational patterns on index streams underlying many irregular workloads: indirection, intersection, and union. Handling these in hardware can accelerate one- and two-sided sparse linear algebra, stencil workloads, sparse neural networks, and quantized data streaming among others. In an existing eight-core RISC-V compute cluster, our extensions incur only 1.8% in additional area over affine stream registers, but accelerate sparse-dense linear algebra, sparse-sparse linear algebra, and stencil codes by up to 5.0x, 5.9x, and 3.7x, respectively while consuming up to 3.0x less energy.</p>

<p>The CHERI ISA extensions for security have been under development for the last 13 years and have seen implementations in the MIPS, RISCV and ARM ISAs. It has recently seen its first commercial RISCV implementation and several companies are showing interest in the technology. The CHERI-RISCV SIG aims to capture a minimum useful specification for CHERI-enhanced RV32 and RV64 ISAs. We aim to support the commercial implementation of a CHERI-enabled single-core RV32 or multicore RV64 configuration. For 64-bit, the ISA would support virtual memory suitable to use in lower-end computing environments that run operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, and seL4. However, our current focus is on vertically integrated hardware-software 32-bit stacks built by early adopters to provide a consistent minimal baseline that future specifications can extend.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Trigonometric functions are used in many embedded systems applications, such as signal and image processing, control theory, communication systems and robotics.

This customization improves the performance reducing the processing time by 24x, energy consumption by 13.5x at the cost of an additional 4% of silicon area.

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Processing data-intense tasks right inside an image sensor system allows to offload real-time constraints from centralized data processing nodes and also to reduce transmission bandwidth requirements. High-performant application-tailored processors emblematize one feasible concept to cope with these demands while still providing flexibility for future revisions of the actual algorithms. This work presents an area-optimized customized RISC-V processing system designed as application-specific instruction set processor (ASIP), which is optimized to accelerate exemplary image processing operations. The proposed ISA extensions exploit single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) concepts on pixel level, resulting in a speedup of 13 (compared to a software-only approach) while increasing the prototype’s FPGA hardware utilization by just 15%.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>There is a bewildering amount of number formats, particularly floating point ones. Each ISA will need to consider which to support. For RISC-V, we argue we need to consider supporting all, but ratify only a few; the ones that have become mainstream. Current ratified extensions of the RISC-V ISA suffices, with the exception of BF16 (Brain floating point format) support (and perhaps rising star FP8). Supporting BF16, however, is also not straightforward. We will identify several use cases; as a storage format, for efficient computations, and as an arithmetic format, and expose BF16 is not a standard, highlighting differences in implementations. For RISC-V support we need to balance flexibility with (hardware) efficiency and will recommend complementary extensions with the base supporting flushing subnormal numbers and round-to-zero.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>The open-source RISC-V ISA has gained popularity due to its customizability and versatility. Its adoption presents challenges in Networks-on-Chips (NoCs) implementation, which impact performance, power consumption, and cost. This paper discusses different protocol options for RISC-V-based SoCs in the context of their unique advantages in terms of flexibility, performance, and coherency. We introduce a physically aware NoC development framework for non-cache-coherent applications. This framework enables better management of physical constraints, reducing interconnect area and power consumption. It addresses the impact of floor planning and layouts on NoC topology development and achieves up to 5X shorter turn-around time than manual iterations. Additionally, the paper introduces an IP development framework for multiprotocol AMBA CHI and ACE cache coherent interconnect.</p>

<p>Small embedded cores have little area, power, or performance budget to spare for security features and yet must often run code written in unsafe languages and, increasingly, are exposed to the hostile Internet. CHERIoT (Capability Hardware Extension to RISC-V for Internet of Things) builds on top of CHERI and RISC-V1 to provide an ISA and software model that lets software depend on object-granularity spatial memory safety, deterministic use-after-free protection, and lightweight compartmentalization exposed directly to the C/C++ language model2,3. This can run existing embedded software components on a clean-slate RTOS that scales up to large numbers of isolated (yet securely communicating) compartments, even on systems with under 256 KiB of SRAM.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>The slowdown of CMOS scaling has led to the widespread use of heterogeneous SoCs that combine general-purpose processor cores with customized accelerators. The immense growth of the RISC-V community means that more and more people are interested in using RISC-V cores in their SoCs. It is thus imperative to obtain tools that allow for fast design space exploration and modeling of these designs. In this paper we describe our effort to port gem5-SALAM, a cutting-edge pre-RTL heterogeneous SoC simulator, to incorporate general-purpose RISC-V cores. In such a way, we provide to the RISC-V community a powerful tool to design, evaluate and optimize such systems.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Microarchitectural timing channels enable information transfer between security domains that are supposed to be isolated, bypassing the operating system’s security boundaries. They result from shared microarchitectural state that depends on execution in one security domain and impacts timing in another. Since modern ISAs do not specify timing behaviour, they are insufficient to address these channels. The temporal fence instruction was recently proposed as a RISC-V extension that clears the processor’s microarchitectural state and thus removes any timing dependence on execution history. It has been demonstrated to be extremely effective at low hardware overhead for in-order RV processors, such as CVA6 [1]. In this work-in-progress, we provide initial insight into the effectiveness and cost of the temporal fence on the open-source, 12-stage, out-of-order RV64GC core OpenC910. We highlight challenges that arise from the out-of-order microarchitecture of OpenC910 and propose an approach that leverages the custom Xthead extension of OpenC910 and minimises the required hardware modifications to enable time protection.</p>

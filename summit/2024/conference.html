    <h4 id="abstract-2">Abstract</h4>

    <p>Customization is the way forward for getting the performance we need in processors. It is evident, and uniquely supported by the flexible and scalable RISC-V ISA. More and more IP vendors realize they need to provide some level of configuration or customization. But there is a big elephant in the room. Is the quality always where it needs to be? We must ensure custom core designs can be exhaustively verified once the desired performance level is reached. By taking our verification efforts to the next level, we empower you to implement custom instructions without risk, reducing the time to market for a verified core.</p>

    <p><em>Plenary on Tuesday June 24th at 12:00.</em></p>

    <h4 id="abstract-3">Abstract</h4>

    <p>This presentation will illustrate the challenges and solutions of data-transport architectures for artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) in the context of embedded vision architectures and discuss implementation aspects for Networks-on-Chips (NoCs) for RISC-V-based System-on-Chips (SoCs). AI/ML and Embedded Vision architectures present unique challenges in data transport architectures to procure all relevant data from off-chip DRAMs and efficiently store and transport them in caches to allow efficient computing on SoCs and systems of chiplets.</p>

    <p>These challenges directly translate into specific requirements for NoC implementation, impacting performance, power consumption, and cost, efficiently addressing the challenges posed by what the industry calls the “memory wall” – the much faster improvement of processor vs. DRAM memory access speed. In addition, for the automotive and industrial application domains, special considerations regarding safety and resilience need to be considered to allow for ISO26262 and related certifications.</p>

    <p><em>Plenary on Tuesday June 24th at 12:15.</em></p>

    <h4 id="abstract-4">Abstract</h4>

    <p>This proposed architecture introduces a novel matrix extension and customized quantization instructions for Risc-V CPUs, specifically for general convolutional neural network (CNN) applications. This presentation emphasizes the design of the matrix multiplication/accumulation instructions, aiming to achieve scalability/portability across diverse VLEN machines (VLEN agnostic). The key objectives include higher computing capacity, intensified compute intensity and reduced memory access bandwidth requirements. Furthermore, this work proposes an associated 2D-load/store unit (LSU) for matrix tiling enhancements and the Zero-Overhead Boundary handling to streamline user configuration cycles. Additionally, a novel quantization instruction is introduced, contributing to the acceleration of the entire CNN computations. By synergistically integrating these state-of-the-art techniques, the architecture demonstrates significant performance enhancements. Preliminary performance data underscores the benefits and the potential acceleration of General Matrix Multiply (GeMM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) workloads. Notable performance metrics include kernel loop MAC utilization rate surpassing 75% and compute intensity up to 9.6 (VLEN 512), achieved through advanced software unrolling techniques.</p>

    <p><em>Demo Theatre on Tuesday June 24th at 12:50.</em></p>

    <h4 id="abstract-6">Abstract</h4>

    <p>RISC-V is gaining immense traction in the embedded space, with more and more application cores emerging as well. This broad range of available cores – coupled with the ability to include custom extensions – opens unprecedented innovation opportunities in the SoC domain. However, verification of those highly parameterized core instances, including their custom extensions, remains a time-consuming challenge. (Keep in mind that state-of-the-art processor DV was mostly practiced by only a few big players in the market prior to RISC-V!) In this presentation we will show an automated, customer-proven flow from ISA level specifications of custom extensions through their exhaustive formal verification; and demonstrate results on popular open-source cores.</p>

    <p><em>Plenary on Tuesday June 24th at 14:30.</em></p>

    <h4 id="abstract-11">Abstract</h4>

    <p>Convolutional Spiking Neural Networks (S-CNNs) have emerged as a promising bio-inspired solution to address the need for low- latency, energy-efficient object-detection and image recognition systems. However, S-CNNs pose a challenge to traditional CPUs, GPUs and neural network accelerators due to their inherent sparsity, spike-based communication between neurons and complex activation functions. We explore a novel mapping methodology for S-CNNs on a general-purpose open-source RISC-V core equipped with Indirection Streaming Semantic Registers, a lightweight ISA extension for accelerating sparse-dense linear algebra. Our methodology shows that it is possible to achieve speedups on S-CNNs microkernels up to 10.23× on a dense baseline and up to 7.68× on an optimized dense implementation for high degrees of sparsity of input features.</p>

    <h4 id="abstract-14">Abstract</h4>

    <p>Designing a Domain Specific Architecture (DSA) is challenge because it requires evaluating the performance of the software before DSA hardware is ready. It also requires repeatedly tuning the micro-architecture and adding custom instructions to meet specific needs. This demo show presents a novel approach to build a virtual RISC-V IP core and SoC with GUI tools, add custom instructions to accelerate AI applications, and profile performance gain with our integrated cycle accurate simulator. The complete workflow can be done in just a few minutes with our sophisticated RISC-V based ESL toolchain.</p>

    <p><em>Plenary on Tuesday June 24th at 15:30.</em></p>

    <h4 id="abstract-15">Abstract</h4>

    <p>The RISC-V open standard enables customized heterogeneous processor solutions targeting performance, area, and energy. In this demo, through Custom Compute, a small core transforms sensor data through DSP operations and detects anomalies through Artificial Intelligence (AI). Without Custom Compute, the system’s energy profile increases and may not complete at the desired frequency, technology node, or time. A new Software / Hardware Interface defined using Codasip Studio with bounded customization increased application performance 5x while vastly limiting the verification effort and risk.</p>

    <h4 id="biography-8">Biography</h4>

    <p>Over my thirty-eight career, I’ve gone from designing workstations, selling semiconductors, small business owner, senior instructor teaching embedded systems and computer architecture, to leading Codasip’s University Program. The common link between all these jobs is my Electrical Engineering degree.</p>

    <p>In the late 1980s, it appeared that every company was developing their own processor architecture, but quickly in the 1990s, the vast different architectures shrank as software binary compatibility became a priority. Over the following years, Dennard Scaling and Moore’s Law broke, resulting in technology evolving from homogeneous to heterogeneous processing where each application is optimized by its specialized processor. With the advent of RISC-V’s Open Standard, a new golden era of processor engineering is upon us to design these specialized solutions.</p>

    <h4 id="abstract-17">Abstract</h4>

    <p>In a constantly evolving world, where deployment of intelligence at the edge presents many challenges (higher computing capacity and memory, and lower energy consumption), the NeuroSoC project, started in September 2022, has the ambition to develop a Multi-Processor System on Chip prototype able to answer those challenges. It will also cope with mass volume production and low-cost requirements, using a solid, mature, and qualified reliable Phase Change Memory technology.
The NeuroSoC prototype will be based on FD-SOI 28nm CMOS technology and will integrate an Analog In Memory Computing Neural Processing Unit, named AIMC IMNPU unit , a local digital processing subsystem, and functional safe multiprocessor host subsystems based on an enhanced version of existing RISC-V microprocessor. Thus, it will enable the support of most of the wide set of edge-AI applications targeting a highly efficient power consumption profile.</p>

    <h4 id="abstract-31">Abstract</h4>

    <p>The widespread industry adoption of the open RISC-V instruction set architecture requires a robust, mature RISC-V software development ecosystem. The upstream LLVM developer tools for RISC-V are evolving rapidly, but still need further improvements to compete with the well-established ARM and x86 architectures. Codee is a new automatic code inspection tool to help developers optimize C/C++/Fortran codes. This is the first work evaluating the impact of Codee on the LLVM RISC-V ecosystem. The results show up to 7.5x performance boost of well-known open-source codes targeting SiFive’s P470 processor using single-core optimizations for vectorization and memory efficiency. The authors are not aware of a similar approach in LLVM and RISC-V and believe Codee is a new and revolutionizing solution that makes the ecosystem even better.</p>

    <p><em>Plenary on Wednesday June 25th at 10:50.</em></p>

    <h4 id="abstract-33">Abstract</h4>

    <p>RISC-V cores can be found in more and more chips - as the main CPU(s) or as a companion core together with other CPU architectures. Each chip and core supplier can decide individually which functions its RISC-V core(s) support and how they are integrated into the overall system. While the complexity of SoCs grows with the number of cores and the number of different core architectures, the challenges for embedded developers grow even more with operating systems, hypervisors, and other software running on multiple cores.
In this presentation experts of Lauterbach, market leader for development tools and strategic member of the RISC-V foundation, show how developers can overcome these challenges with the right tools and debug strategies. They explain how to debug cores from RISC-V and other architectures simultaneously via one debug interface and one debug probe to gain insight into the entire embedded system. The presentation covers real-time on- and off-chip tracing for all major RISC-V trace systems as well as the utilization of standardized RISC-V debug and trace interfaces.
All in all, the attendee learns that multicore debugging with RISC-V cores is not rocket science and that there are efficient methods to master even complex chips with complex software configurations.</p>

    <p>The RISC-V IOMMU provides capabilities supporting device assignment, which is the provision of host devices to virtual machines where they appear to the guest operating systems as though they have been physically attached. Beyond the restriction of device DMAs to guest memory, the RISC-V IOMMU, in conjunction with the RISC-V AIA, additionally supports directing interrupts to guest VCPUs, which is a feature also referred to as irqbypass.  We demonstrate device assignment with the RISC-V IOMMU including its irqbypass support on a Linux/KVM host running on a QEMU machine model.</p>

    <p><em>Plenary on Wednesday June 25th at 12:15.</em></p>

    <h4 id="abstract-38">Abstract</h4>

    <p>The RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) is popular for its extensibility. However, a quick exploration of instruction candidates fails due to the lack of tools to auto-generate embedded software toolchain support. This work establishes a semi-automated flow to generate LLVM compiler support for custom instructions based on a C-style ISA description language. The implemented Seal5 tool is capable of generating support for functionalities ranging from baseline assembler-level support, over builtin functions to compiler code generation patterns for scalar as well as vector instructions. The approach is demonstrated using the Core-V instruction set extensions and custom SHA-256 operations. The autogenerated LLVM toolchain reduces development times drastically while performing similarly or better compared to the existing, manually implemented Core-V reference LLVM toolchain on a wide variety of benchmarks.</p>

    <p><em>Plenary on Wednesday June 25th at 14:30.</em></p>

    <h4 id="abstract-40">Abstract</h4>

    <p>In the last decade, we have witnessed exponential growth in the complexity of control systems for safety-critical applications (automotive, robots, industrial automation) and their transition to heterogeneous mixed-criticality systems (MCSs). The growth of the RISC-V ecosystem is creating a major opportunity to develop open-source, vendor-neutral reference platforms for safety-critical computing. We present SentryCore, a reliable, real-time, self-contained, open-source mega-IP for advanced control functions that can be seamlessly integrated into Systems-on-Chip, e.g., for automotive applications, through industry-standard Advanced eXtensible Interface 4 (AXI4). SentryCore features three embedded RISC-V processor cores in lockstep with error-correcting code (ECC) protected data memory for reliable execution of any safety-critical application. Context switching is accelerated to under 110 clock cycles via a RISC-V core-local interrupt controller (CLIC) and dedicated hardware extensions, while a timer-based direct memory access (DMA) engine streamlines sensor data readout during periodic control loops. SentryCore was implemented in Intel’s 16nm process node and tested with FreeRTOS, ThreadX, and RTIC software support.</p>

    <p><em>Plenary on Wednesday June 25th at 14:45.</em></p>

    <h4 id="abstract-41">Abstract</h4>

    <p>The significant re-work to port an application software, the lack of viable key items like low-cost hardware platforms for validation and test, hardware abstraction layer stacks, availability of integrated free-of-charge IDEs with integrated  toolchains, reliable and committed debug support: all these pose a threat and create adoption barriers for a broader adoption of RISC-V in the microcontroller space.</p>

    <p>This can hinder  engineers from getting hands-on experience with the RISC-V platform, slow down the expansion of RISC-V within the microcontroller broad market, and further delay its momentum.</p>

    <p>During this presentation, attendees will learn how Renesas contributes to the expansion of the RISC-V ecosystem for MCUs by deploying high quality devices and tools including a fully supported and free of charge IDE with compiler toolchain, low-cost prototyping hardware, and enabling support on commercial environments behind the proof-of-concept phase.</p>

    <p><strong>Joshua Zivkovic, Codethink and Lukas Wirth, Ferrous Systems</strong></p>

    <p><em>Plenary on Wednesday June 25th at 16:00.</em></p>

    <h4 id="abstract-44">Abstract</h4>

    <p>The Rust Project supports a large number of targets for the Rust compiler and tooling. This support is separated into levels called “tiers”. Tier-1 is the top tier with the greatest amount of commitment from the project. In order for platforms to qualify for tier-1 status there is a significant set of conditions which must be met. Our project, in conjunction with RISE, is to bridge the gap between tiers one and two, to elevate the status of 64-bit RISC-V Linux support to tier-1.</p>

    <p>This talk will serve as a small introduction of the Rust quality assurance methods. It will also cover the RISC-V specific work that has been done to date, the current status of the platform support, and what work remains to be done to complete tier-1 support. We will cover any platform-specific bug fixes and development work done to enable support, and we will outline ways in which the RISC-V community could engage with the Rust ecosystem to continue to ensure continued support once tier-1 status is achieved.</p>

    <p>We will also discuss the involvement of RISE in the RISC-V and Rust communities, along with our impression of how the Rust programming language could play a significant role in the advancement of RISC-V uptake.</p>

    <p><em>Plenary on Thursday June 26th at 09:30.</em></p>

    <h4 id="abstract-50">Abstract</h4>

    <p>High-performance architectures are increasingly heterogeneous and incorporate often specialized hardware. We have first seen the generalization of GPUs in the most powerful machines, followed by FPGAs, and now by many other accelerators such as Tensor Processor Units (TPUs) for Deep Neural Networks, or variable precision FPUs. Recent hardware manufacturing trends make it very likely that specialization will not only persist, but increase. Manually managing this heterogeneity is complex and not maintainable. We therefore propose to revisit how we design both hardware and OS in order to better hide the heterogeneity. To ensure long term viability of our proposal, we propose to entertain the use of 128-bit addressing</p>

    <p><em>Plenary on Thursday June 26th at 09:45.</em></p>

    <h4 id="abstract-51">Abstract</h4>

    <p>Application-specific instruction-set processors (ASIPs) can significantly improve performance and energy-efficiency for a predefined set of priority applications, while also offering high flexibility via compiler-supported programmability. Designing and programming these type of customized processors often relies on hardware-software co-design toolsets that are able to adapt to a high-level processor description, and therefore, offer a robust way of efficiently implementing tailored processors. We present an open-source hardware-software co-design toolset for programming and designing RISC-V based ASIPs. We demonstrate the toolset by designing a custom instruction set extension for three cryptographic algorithms, which results in a 44\% reduction in run time with negligible overheads in clock frequency and area utilization of the synthesized processor implementation.</p>

    <p><em>Plenary on Thursday June 26th at 10:00.</em></p>

    <h4 id="abstract-52">Abstract</h4>

    <p>The RISC-V ecosystem is quickly growing and has gained a lot of traction in the FPGA community, as it permits free customization of both ISA and micro-architectural features. However, the design of the corresponding micro-architecture is costly and error-prone. We address this issue by providing a flow capable of automatically synthesizing pipelined micro-architectures directly from an Instruction Set Simulator in C/C++. Our flow is based on HLS technology and bridges part of the gap between Instruction Set Processor design flows and High-Level Synthesis tools by taking advantage of speculative loop pipelining. Our results show that our flow is general enough to support a variety of ISA and micro-architectural extensions, and is capable of producing circuits that are competitive with manually designed cores.</p>

    <h4 id="abstract-55">Abstract</h4>

    <p>The cornerstone of all security applications is hardware, underscoring the importance of meticulously verifying its security features. As the adoption of RISC-V grows, there is an increasing emphasis on enhancing security features in ASIC and FPGA designs. The protection of sensitive data, including encryption keys, passwords, and biometric information, is paramount, as these are prime targets for security breaches that can lead to costly, damaging, and embarrassing consequences. Challenges in security verification that must be addressed include ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and inversion, as well as mitigating the exploitation of sneak paths, addressing inefficient verification flows, and managing the added complexity. In this context, formal technology stands out as the sole method that guarantees the security requirements of datapaths are fulfilled. Our methodology introduces a high degree automation to expedite the security verification process, showcasing its applicability and debugging prowess in a RISC-V implementation, specifically with OpenTitan. The paper will present our findings, providing detailed explanations and runtime information, highlighting our approach’s effectiveness in enhancing security verification.</p>

    <p>We have started the development of a new payload Control &amp; Data Processing Unit (CDPU), an Instrument Control Unit (ICU) with additional data processing capabilities targeted towards ‘New Space’ SmallSats instruments. We defined a modular architecture to allow flexibility in interfaces and functions, with advanced and reliable in-orbit FPGA reprogrammability. The FPGA firmware includes a RISC-V softcore and optional accelerators, allowing for edge processing. This opens the door for payload control, encryption and data processing in space, leveraging the RISC-V ecosystem. The CDPU will act as a hub for (optical) instruments that forms a logical bridge between the instruments and the SmallSat platform. It will offer standardized hardware interfaces for integrated optical instruments, as well as sophisticated facilities for processing the science data before it is sent down to earth. The CDPU also reduces time-to-orbit by removing the need to design an instrument for a specific platform.</p>

    <p><em>Plenary on Thursday June 26th at 14:45.</em></p>

    <h4 id="abstract-58">Abstract</h4>

    <p>Functional models of RISC-V processors are critical to the success of RISC-V projects, whether users are developing the processors themselves or licensing the processor IP.  These models enable architectural exploration at the beginning of the project, including the addition and optimization of custom instructions, provide a reference model for design verification of the processor, and provide a high performance, instruction accurate model for virtual prototypes for software development.  Key requirements for these models are ease of use, flexible configuration, including adding custom instructions, CSRs, etc., and high performance of the models.  This paper discusses the use of the open standard Open Virtual Platforms (OVP) APIs used in C/C++ for building high performance processor models.</p>

    <p>In this paper model architecture will be discussed, and an overview of the OVP APIs presented.  Details of APIs to support specific features will be presented, using the OpenHW Group CVW “Wally” processor being developed by Harvey Mudd College and Oklahoma State University.  Examples of adding custom instructions to a RISC-V processor will be presented, including both the technical details and the resource requirements, to demonstrate the ease of use of model development via the OVP APIs.  Benchmark simulation results, both for bare metal and OS applications, will be shown for both single processor and multiple processor/hart platforms, to show the linear scalability of performance.</p>

    <p>The CHERI Task Group was recently formed within RISC-V International to propose extensions supporting CHERI in the RISC-V ISA. The motivation of these extensions is to enhance RISC-V with features to address memory safety issues which account for over 70% of software vulnerabilities according to Microsoft’s Security Response Center (MSRC). In this presentation, we will provide an overview of the CHERI TG’s present and future work as well as the status of the specifications of the CHERI extensions.</p>

    <p><em>Plenary on Thursday June 26th at 16:30.</em></p>

    <h4 id="abstract-60">Abstract</h4>

    <p>We report our work on extending the open-source RISC-V CVA6 with CHERI support. Our implementation complies with version 9 of the CHERI RISC-V specification. Currently, we are evaluating and validating our design in an experimental single-core system-on-chip (SoC) in a simulation and FPGA emulation environment. To our knowledge, this will be the first public RISC-V CPU with hardware virtualization and CHERI support. We plan to release our CVA6H-CHERI core as an open-source artifact to the RISC-V and CHERI community.</p>

    <p><em>Plenary on Thursday June 26th at 16:45.</em></p>

    <h4 id="abstract-61">Abstract</h4>

    <p>RISC-V semantics are specified in prose and in a formal model using a language called Sail.
The latter does not yet implement all ratified standard extensions.
This work presents an implementation of the missing hypervisor extension into the official Sail model.
Necessary modifications and additions to the model are checked for regressions using bundled tests.
They are verified using a testsuite that is developed together with the model and with two third-party testsuites.
Furthermore, the extracted emulator is able to boot Linux on top of a type 1 hypervisor.
Both the formal model implementation and our testsuite may prove to be useful for the development and verification of future systems that implement the H-extension.
Finally, the formal model enables future work to create rigorous proofs about hypervisor extension features and the software that relies on them.</p>

    <p><strong>Luis Cunha, University of Minho</strong></p>

    <p><em>Plenary on Thursday June 26th at 17:00.</em></p>

    <h4 id="abstract-62">Abstract</h4>

    <p>This work describes the design and implementation of an open-source I/O Physical Memory Protection (IOPMP) IP compliant with the RISC-V IOPMP Architecture Specification (version 1.0.0-draft5). So far, we have designed and implemented an IP with the mandatory features supporting the Full model. We functionally validated and evaluated this IP within a CVA6-based SoC. Future plans include updating the IP to comply with the ratified specification and expanding its capabilities, such as incorporating additional operation models (e.g., Dynamic-K) and optional features (e.g., MDLCK). Finally, we intend to open-source the IP for the RISC-V community.</p>

    <p><strong>Alex Wezel, RPTU Kaiserslautern-Landau</strong></p>

    <p><em>Plenary on Thursday June 26th at 17:15.</em></p>

    <h4 id="abstract-63">Abstract</h4>

    <p>The seemingly endless stream of previously unknown microarchitectural attacks and security flaws in hardware systems is
driving the need for more efficient and comprehensive verification techniques. Unique Program Execution Checking (UPEC)
is a formal verification methodology that can be used to verify a wide variety of security requirements for hardware at the
Register Transfer Level (RTL). With its white-box nature and reusable verification IP, UPEC complements the open-source
ecosystem provided by RISC-V. We demonstrate the efficacy of UPEC through a set of selected case studies, covering different
threat models and ranging from small RISC-V processors to entire Systems-on-Chips (SoCs).</p>

</p>

    <p><a href="https://riscv.org">RISC-V</a>, the open standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture">instruction set
architecture
(ISA)</a>, is
enabling a range of new applications and research that will define the
future of computing in Europe. The region has been central to RISC-V’s
success, with one-third of RISC-V’s global community based in Europe.</p>

    <p><strong>RISC-V Summit Europe</strong> takes place in <strong>Paris</strong> from <strong>Monday 12th to
Thursday 15th May, 2025</strong>. The combination of strong industrial and
academic communities is key to the success of RISC-V in Europe, and
for this reason the conference is designed to help attendees to
explore both commercial and research applications.  <em>RISC-V Summit
Europe</em> is an opportunity not to be missed. Come to Paris to be part
of the new wave of European computing innovation!</p>

    <p>T2.3.01, Wednesday 14 at 11:30, in Gaston Berger amphitheater (S2).</p>

    <p>By <strong>Edward Wilford</strong>, Senior Research Manager, Omdia.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: For decades, the automotive sector has been considered something of an island, with a high moat and a unique development cycle. However, in recent years and spurred mainly by a rich crop of new entrants from China, automotive technology has accelerated and broadened. A new focus on more general-purpose compute, driven by a software-first approach, has as an unintended but beneficial consequence opened up the barriers between automotive and industrial applications, and paved the way for product development shaped more by function than application. This talk will demonstrate that the various software-defined system revolutions are in fact a single phenomenon happening across industries, anywhere where advanced edge deployments are on the rise. Furthermore, why this presents itself as a unique opportunity for RISC-V will be discussed.</p>

    <p>By <strong>Nick Brown</strong>, Senior Research Fellow, ECC.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: For all it’s successes in embedded computing, RISC-V is yet to become mainstream in High Performance Computing (HPC). However, times are changing and at the same time that RISC-V is making progress towards more high end usage, the HPC community is facing unprecedented challenges around meeting the demand for increased performance but in a more sustainable manner. RISC-V has an opportunity to displace entrenched technologies here, and in this talk I will highlight the key benefits that RISC-V can provide to HPC, describe some of the important activities and early achievements in this area, and identify critical missing pieces that we as the RISC-V community should look to prioritise.</p>

    <p>By <strong>Georgi Kuzmanov</strong>, Senior Programme Officer, Chips JU.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The Chips Joint Undertaking (JU) was established in September, 2023, to implement the Chips for Europe Initiative, the first pillar of the European Chips Act and to continue the missions of its preceding joint technology initiatives in the field of electronic components and systems (ECS). For several years now, the Chips JU has been supporting two topics of common European interest, namely– Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) and RISC V based design of ECS. These two topics, initially pursued independently, have naturally converged into joint actions targeting the development of industrially significant RISC V based platforms, which support the digital Vehicle-of-the-Future (VoF) paradigm. This talk will reveal the evolution and the current state-of-play of Chips JU’s activities in the fields of SDV and RISC V. The context will be the inevitable transformation of traditional automotive industry towards digitalization to meet the global challenges in the sector.  Chips JU’s vision to employ RISC V based systems supporting SDV via hardware abstraction and consequently building a holistic digital platform for the VoF will be argued. This approach is seen as an advantageous strategic choice with significant potential impact, leading towards European technological sovereignty and more cost-efficient, thus more competitive and innovative, car manufacturing.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: RISC-V in space is becoming a tangible reality, with several missions already flying it. This presentation highlights the European Space Agency (ESA) latest developments to advance the adoption of this open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) in space systems. The portfolio of RISC-V centred System-on-Chip (SoC) for space is growing, with new devices soon going to be manufactured and offered in the market. Such SoCs bring unique space-related features as well as technical and programmatical challenges, which are presented in this talk. RISC-V in space is further supported by ESA by promoting the design and implementation of high-performance, reliable IP cores, and the establishment of a robust software ecosystem. In addition, the Ultra Deep Submicron (UDSM) initiative will be presented, showing how advanced semiconductor technology development is further accelerating the integration of RISC-V into space-grade electronics.

    <p><strong>By Adnan Hamid.</strong></p>

    <p>The advent of RISC-V has presented verification teams with many new
verification challenges. Complex interactions at the system level,
that must be considered when developing a RISC-V core, include
uncommon scenarios for block level verification teams. As we move
towards more system-level verification and RISC-V Application
Processors in general, these types of scenarios will become
commonplace. As such, RISC-V verification provides, among many other
things, an interesting learning vehicle for general verification
challenges to come. This workshop will discuss a specific complex, but
yet commonplace, verification challenge for any team working on a
complex RISC-V core. We will consider the verification of a Memory
Management Unit (MMU) that includes virtualization and hypervisor
operation. These scenarios need to consider both Single- and
Multi-core devices along with an Input Output Memory Management Unit
(IOMMU) and uncore IP interaction. The workshop will contain valuable
information for any engineer or manager involved with the design of a
RISC-V core or using a RISC-V core on their SoC.</p>

    <p><strong>Audience:</strong> any engineer involved with the design or verification
of a RISC-V core, or any end user of a core on an SoC.</p>

    <p><strong>Requirements:</strong> None. The tutorial will consist of presentations and
demos, and will not be hands on.</p>

    <h3 id="t33--expedited-development-of-novel-risc-v-instructions-through-an-emulation-simulation-framework">T3.3 – Expedited development of novel RISC-V instructions through an emulation-simulation framework</h3>

    <p><strong>By Julián Pavón and Iván Vargas.</strong></p>

    <p>Given the widespread adoption of the RISC-V ISA by notable industry
players like Google, Huawei, Intel, and others, a significant
opportunity emerges for software developers and hardware architects to
conceive and present innovative solutions readily integrable into
commercial products. Furthermore, the inherent flexibility of RISC-V
allows for seamless augmentation with new instructions aimed at
expediting various domain-specific algorithms, thereby inviting
computer architecture researchers to propose inventive instructions
conducive to achieving the aforementioned objective. However, the
process of designing and assessing new instructions for RISC-V
presents a substantial time investment due to the current
methodologies and simulation tools employed for evaluation. Notably,
computer architecture and RTL simulators, such as gem5 and Verilator,
entail protracted simulation times, rendering them inefficient for the
initial phases of instruction development characterized by iterative
program versioning and integration of new instructions.</p>

    <p>Our objective is to enhance the efficiency of designing and evaluating
new instructions within the RISC-V ISA, thereby reducing the entry
barriers for researchers seeking to apply RISC-V to their respective
domain-specific challenges. We will provide a comprehensive
explanation about our top-to-bottom evaluation framework, which
enables quick design and evaluation of new RISC-V instructions going
through software stack integration to performance simulation.</p>

    <p>The instructional program will comprise a blend of informative
lectures and interactive lab sessions. Initially, participants will
receive a comprehensive overview of diverse tools essential for both
software and hardware development tailored to platforms supporting the
RISC-V ISA. Subsequently, we will delve into the specifics of our
evaluation framework, elucidating the utilization of one ISA emulator
(QEMU) alongside a computer architecture simulator (gem5).</p>

    <p>Furthermore, we will elucidate the integration methodology of these
tools to expedite software development of new instructions via ISA
emulators and to assess the performance of the developed instructions
using computer architecture simulators. To facilitate hands-on
learning, we will furnish our evaluation framework through a docker
image, encompassing the aforementioned tools, along with requisite
wrappers and scripts for seamless integration.</p>

    <p>Additionally, practical exercises and example code will be provided
during the lab sessions, enabling attendees to gain firsthand
experience in the design, integration, and evaluation of new RISC-V
instructions using our framework. Ultimately, all participants will
depart equipped with the evaluation framework, code samples, and the
necessary proficiency to employ them as foundational elements in their
individual research endeavor.</p>

    <p><strong>Audience:</strong> The tutorial is tailored for a diverse audience,
encompassing computer architecture researchers with a keen interest in
integrating the RISC-V ISA into their research endeavors, and who seek
a proficient tool to commence their work within this ISA
domain. Moreover, it caters to researchers already immersed in RISC-V,
aiming to augment their design methodology with a comprehensive
top-to-bottom evaluation framework.  Hardware developers exploring
avenues for expedited performance assessment of new RISC-V
instructions, prior to embarking on hardware modules in RTL, will find
substantial value in this tutorial. Additionally, graduate and
undergraduate students with a passion for computer systems and
embedded systems are well-positioned to benefit from this tutorial, as
it provides hands-on coding experiences facilitating the modeling and
evaluation of diverse CPU architectures.</p>

    <h3 id="cheri--tgsig">CHERI- TG/SIG</h3>

    <p><strong>Description of SIG</strong></p>

    <p>The CHERI SIG will work on a strategy for adding Capability Hardware
Enhanced RISC Instructions (CHERI) to the RISC-V ISA. Enabling a
capability-based security model will ensure that RISC-V can provide
strong security guarantees as well as mechanisms for
compartmentalization that are more scalable than traditional
techniques like PMP (physical memory protection) and MMU (memory
management unit). This SIG will work towards defining a CHERI-enabled
instruction set extension, toolchain requirements, programming model
and psABI (processor-specific application binary interface).</p>

    <p><strong>Description of CHERI TG</strong></p>

    <p>Memory safety is the biggest security threat to computer systems:
Microsoft and Google Chromium identifying 70% of their critical
vulnerabilities being in this class. CHERI-based memory safety has
arisen from research starting in 2010 to be the focus of the <a href="https://www.dsbd.tech">Innovate
UK Digital Security by Design Program</a> (£90m UK
government funding and over £200m from industry). Under this program,
ARM Ltd has produced the Morello prototype: quad-core CHERI-ARM
superscalar processors and GPU on a 7nm TSMC process, demonstrating
little performance or area penalty from adding this security
technology. Initially 1,000 Morello units have been shipped to
partners for evaluation.</p>

    <p>Microsoft’s Security Response Center’s 42-page report <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/MSRC-Security-Research/blob/master/papers/2020/Security%20analysis%20of%20CHERI%20ISA.pdf">Security
Analysis of CHERI
ISA</a>
concludes that over ⅔ of all of Microsoft’s critical memory-safety
vulnerabilities in 2019 would have been deterministically mitigated by
CHERI - the closest competing technology, tagged memory extensions,
achieved only 13% deterministic mitigation. Tens of millions of lines
of C/C++ code have now been ported to CHERI including work by

Limited</a>
who measured just 0.026% lines-of-code change when porting an

CHERIoT RTOS demonstrates how CHERI can provide scalable
compartmentalisation and memory protection, which is more scalable and
uses comparable silicon area to a PMP (physical memory protection as
defined in the RISC-V privileged spec). The intergovernmental report

    <h3 id="timing-fences-twg">Timing Fences TWG</h3>

    <p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>

    <p>Covert channels are communication channels that a supervisor cannot
observe or control. Timing channels are covert channels that exploit
timing interferences caused by competition for shared
microarchitectural resources, such as caches, buffers, and branch
predictors. For instance, timing channels can be used to extract
secrets as part of a microarchitectural speculation attack, such as
Spectre-like attacks.</p>

    <p>To prevent timing channels, shared hardware resources must be strictly
partitioned between isolated applications. The Timing Fences Task
Group will propose a small ISA extension to enable such partitioning
of shared microarchitectural states. For instance, we will introduce a
temporal fence instruction that can be used to temporally partition
shared on-core microarchitectural states by clearing them, e.g., when
switching between isolated applications.</p>

    <p>The proposed RISC-V Timing Fences TG will collaborate to produce:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A small ISA extension (possibly no more than one or two instructions, or only a new CSR).</li>
      <li>A non-normative short guide: defining threat models, developing rationale, etc.</li>
      <li>A proof-of-concept implementation, including both a prototype RISC-V core and a compiler that manages the necessary intrinsics.</li>
      <li>A test strategy guide, including a test suite for common covert channels.</li>
      <li>The Sail model corresponding to this extension.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The TG will work with the appropriate Priv/Unpriv ISA committee,
Architecture Review Committee, and Security HC.</p>

    <p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>

    <p>The Core-Local Interrupt Controller (CLIC) Privileged Architecture
Extensions are designed to provide low-latency, vectored, pre-emptive
interrupts for RISC-V systems. When activated the CLIC subsumes and
replaces the original RISC-V basic local interrupt scheme. The CLIC
has a base design that requires minimal hardware, but supports
additional extensions to provide hardware acceleration. The goal of
the CLIC is to provide support for a variety of software ABI and
interrupt models, without complex hardware that can impact
high-performance implementations.</p>

    <h3 id="attached-matrix-ext-ame">Attached Matrix Ext (AME)</h3>

    <p>Matrix operations are a key operation in deep-learning training and
inference for workloads like natural-language processing,
recommendation systems, and image recognition. With the pervasive use
of these applications in environments ranging from the datacenter,
through IoT to mobile applications, matrix operations for RISC-V
should scale acrsoss these application domains and apply to
high-performance and resource-constrained environments.</p>

    <p>The Matrix Operations Unit TG will specify an attached Matrix
Operations Unit Extension. An attached matrix unit executes
instructions that are part of the processor instruction stream and,
from an architectural perspective, must follow program order. An
attached matrix unit is also self-contained and orthogonal to other
architectural resources: it defines its own set of matrix registers
and uses these as part of its specified operations.</p>

    <p>The Matrix Operations Unit will specify an extension to the RISC-V ISA
that implements a scalable (i.e., with the ability to operate on
different operand sizes and allow the writing of matrix-geometry
agnostic code) matrix operations unit. This matrix operations unit
will be a standalone block implementable without dependencies on the
RISC-V Vector extension.</p>

    <p>The resulting specification will encompass:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>an overview of the commonly used matrix operations in established
algorithms and commonly used software libraries;</li>
      <li>a specification of the architectural state capable of
holding/referencing two-dimensional matrix tiles of
configurable/variable geometry;</li>
      <li>a specification of those matrix operations supported as part of
this extension, including at least:
        <ul>
          <li>load, store, and move operations
            <ul>
              <li>between memory and the matrix tile architectural state</li>
              <li>(if implemented together with the RISC-V Vector extension)
between RISC-V vector registers and rows/columns of the
matrix tile architectural state</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>matrix-matrix, vector-matrix and scalar-matrix arithmetic
operations</li>
          <li>matrix permutation operations</li>
          <li>sparse-matrix compression/decompression;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>a predication mechanism to control operations performed on matrix
tiles;</li>
      <li>a mapping of matrix operations onto instructions defined in the
(newly defined) Matrix Operations Extension; and</li>
      <li>a review of the interactions of matrix load/store and prefetching
of matrices with the RISC-V memory models and a specification of
any deviations from the standard RISC-V memory model.</li>
    </ul>

and are necessary to boot and operate systems in every product from
IOT/embedded through Data Center/Cloud and beyond. By their nature
these components are also often matrixed into other committees
pertaining to security, RAS, platforms, etc. The intent is to provide
a robust set of specifications that product implementers need to be
successful while minimizing duplication of effort and fragmentation of
design choices in the RISC-V community.</p>

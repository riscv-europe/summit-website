    <h3 id="risc-v-isa-extensions-with-hardware-acceleration-for-hyperdimensional-computing">RISC-V ISA Extensions with Hardware Acceleration for Hyperdimensional Computing</h3>

    <p>T1.3.02 (sub. #109), Tue 13 at 12:00, in Gaston Berger.</p>

    <p>By <strong>Rocco Martino</strong>, Sapienza University of Rome. <strong>Marco Angioli</strong>, Sapienza University of Rome. <strong>Antonello Rosato</strong>, Sapienza University of Rome. <strong>Marcello Barbirotta</strong>, Sapienza University of Rome. <strong>Abdallah Cheikh</strong>, Sapienza University of Rome. <strong>Mauro Olivieri</strong>, Sapienza University of Rome.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) leverages high-dimensional distributed representations called hypervectors
(HVs) and simple arithmetic operations, making it an ideal paradigm for learning tasks on resource-constrained
devices. This work introduces the first RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) extension specifically designed
to execute all fundamental arithmetic operations of HDC directly through dedicated instructions, which, when
appropriately combined, enable a variety of learning tasks by efficiently encoding and processing information.
This extension is coupled with a specialized hardware acceleration unit, integrated into the Klessydra-T03 RISC-V
core, to perform computations on binary HVs efficiently. The proposed solution enables a seamless trade-off
between execution time and hardware resource utilization through both synthesis-time configurability and runtime
programmability. The custom ISA extension is fully integrated into the RISC-V GCC toolchain, allowing
software developers to exploit its capabilities via intrinsic function calls. Benchmarking on an FPGA platform
demonstrates significant performance improvements across a wide range of HDC tasks, from basic arithmetic
operations to real-world classification problems.</p>

    <p>T1.3.03 (sub. #206), Tue 13 at 12:15, in Gaston Berger.</p>

    <p>By <strong>Alexey Khomich</strong>, Synopsys Inc. <strong>Evgenii Paltsev</strong>, Synopsys. <strong>Paul Stravers</strong>, Synopsys Inc.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The Real-Time Interrupt Architecture (RTIA) is the evolution of RISC-V Advanced Interrupt Architecture (AIA) targeted to extend use cases to real-time latency critical scenarios and/or to resource constrained designs. The RTIA defines necessary mechanisms for interrupt nesting and low latency fixed overhead interrupt handling. Keeping compatibility with RISC-V Privileged ISA and RISC-V AIA, the RTIA provides the same programming model for light weight embedded applications and heavy feature rich systems allowing mixing it in virtual environments.</p>

    <p>T1.3.04 (sub. #148), Tue 13 at 12:30, in Gaston Berger.</p>

    <p>By <strong>Ren Guo</strong>, Alibaba Damo Academy.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: With the increasing diversification of intelligent computing workloads, traditional programming paradigms face multidimensional challenges driven by architectural innovations. Addressing the concurrent demands of heterogeneous tasks, including AI inference, real-time graphics rendering, and high-performance signal processing, this presentation focuses on atomic IO enqueue instructions - the core technology enabling hardware accelerator interactions in heterogeneous computing architectures. This approach establishes efficient accelerator communication mechanisms through hardware primitives such as 64-byte atomic enqueue transfers and queue status feedback. At the protocol level, PCIe specifications define DMWr TLP (Transaction Layer Packet) for non-post write operations, while Armv8.7/9.2 implements 64-byte atomic enqueue operations via ST64BV instructions, and x86 architectures provide comparable functionality through MOVDIR64B and ENQCMD(S) instructions.</p>

    <p>This presentation introduces RISC-V’s Atomic IO Enqueue Extension (AIOE) and its virtualization enhancements: the G-stage Page Table In-Process Context (GIPC) mechanism for RISC-V IOMMU, which improves accelerator sharing work queue in multi-tenant environments. In addition, we will share AIOE’s latency mitigation approach for PCI-e.</p>

    <p>T1.3.05 (sub. #86), Tue 13 at 12:45, in Gaston Berger.</p>

    <p>By <strong>Pei-Hsiang Hung</strong>, Andes Technology. <strong>Chung-Hua Yen</strong>, Andes Technology. <strong>I-WEI WU</strong>, Andes Technology.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Matrix multiplication is a critical operation in a wide range of compute-intensive applications, including machine learning, image processing, and scientific computing. The computational demands of large-scale matrix operations necessitate specialized hardware acceleration to improve efficiency and performance. To address this challenge, RISC-V International (RVI) formed the Integrated Matrix Extension (IME) Task Group. To serve immediate market demands, Andes Technology implements the Andes Matrix Multiplication (AMM) instruction set, an extension to the RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV), which Andes presented in IME meetings. The AMM instruction set introduces two primary enhancements:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Matrix operations optimized for 8-bit integers, specifically targeting AI and deep learning applications</li>
      <li>Advanced 2D load/store instructions that minimize memory access overhead</li>
    </ol>

    <p>To assess AMM’s capabilities, we integrated it into the Intermediate Representation Execution Environment (IREE) for efficient compilation and execution on AMM-enabled RISC-V systems. A key aspect of this implementation involved extending IREE’s compilation infrastructure, which included:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Developing a new MLIR pass to tensorize matrix multiplication and tensor data load/store operations</li>
      <li>Designing a custom MLIR dialect tailored for AMM to support all its instructions.</li>
      <li>Implementing conversion passes to lower matrix multiplication and tensor operations from the vector dialect to AMM one</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Our evaluation covered a broad spectrum of AI models, ranging from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to large language models (LLMs), to measure performance improvements. This presentation explores the integration process, shares benchmark results, and discusses strategies for optimizing AI workloads using AMM and RISC-V Vector Extensions. We also examine the challenges encountered during AI model compilation and consider future developments in RISC-V-based AI acceleration.</p>

    <p>T1.7.03 (sub. #170), Tue 13 at 17:00, in Gaston Berger.</p>

    <p>By <strong>Raja Gopal Hari Vijay Sitharaman</strong>, Zoho Corporation.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Medical AI applications—including diagnostics, predictive analytics, and robotic surgery—demand specialized processing capabilities and must meet stringent performance requirements. However, in medical AI commercialization, meeting these demands is only part of the challenge. A critical hurdle is ensuring compliance with stringent regulatory standards such as FDA (U.S.), CE (Europe), and MDR (Medical Device Regulation), while maintaining innovation, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Traditional, some proprietary architecture often present significant barriers to achieving this balance. In contrast, RISC-V, with its open-source, modular ISA design, offers a key to unlocking this potential and fosters open collaboration, accelerating AI-specific optimizations across diverse applications. Its flexibility allows for tailored AI acceleration and secure computing – leading to, for example, significantly faster image processing times in diagnostic imaging or lower latency in real-time. This and verifiable regulatory compliance across hardware, operating systems, and software stacks of the RISC-V ecosystem, lower entry barriers and increase profitability by reducing development costs and speeding up time-to-market. This paper explores how RISC-V’s open ecosystem supports regulatory adherence, drives AI-optimized medical solutions, and unlocks new opportunities for scalable, secure, and cost-effective AI-driven healthcare innovations.</p>

    <p>By <strong>Edward Wilford</strong>, Senior Research Manager, Omdia.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: For decades, the automotive sector has been considered something of an island, with a high moat and a unique development cycle. However, in recent years and spurred mainly by a rich crop of new entrants from China, automotive technology has accelerated and broadened. A new focus on more general-purpose compute, driven by a software-first approach, has as an unintended but beneficial consequence opened up the barriers between automotive and industrial applications, and paved the way for product development shaped more by function than application. This talk will demonstrate that the various software-defined system revolutions are in fact a single phenomenon happening across industries, anywhere where advanced edge deployments are on the rise. Furthermore, why this presents itself as a unique opportunity for RISC-V will be discussed.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Open-source RISC-V cores are increasingly adopted in high-end embedded domains such as automotive, where maximizing instructions per cycle (IPC) is becoming critical. Building on the industry-supported open-source CVA6 core and its superscalar variant, CVA6S, we introduce CVA6S+, an enhanced version incorporating improved branch prediction, register renaming and enhanced operand forwarding. These optimizations enable CVA6S+ to achieve a 43.5% performance improvement over the scalar configuration and 10.9% over CVA6S, with an area overhead of just 9.30% over the scalar core (CVA6). Furthermore, we integrate CVA6S+ with the OpenHW Core-V High-Performance L1 Dcache (HPDCache) and report a 74.1% bandwidth improvement over the legacy CVA6 cache subsystem.</p>

This work extends QEMU to enable big-endian execution, allowing the booting of a big-endian Linux system with OpenSBI. Modifications were required across QEMU, OpenSBI, the Linux kernel, and supporting libraries to ensure correct memory operations, instruction encoding, and runtime patching. The project demonstrates the feasibility of big-endian support for RISC-V, providing a foundation for future hardware and software development.</p>

    <p>T2.5.01, Wed 14 at 14:30, in Gaston Berger.</p>

    <p>By <strong>Nick Brown</strong>, Senior Research Fellow, ECC.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: For all it’s successes in embedded computing, RISC-V is yet to become mainstream in High Performance Computing (HPC). However, times are changing and at the same time that RISC-V is making progress towards more high end usage, the HPC community is facing unprecedented challenges around meeting the demand for increased performance but in a more sustainable manner. RISC-V has an opportunity to displace entrenched technologies here, and in this talk I will highlight the key benefits that RISC-V can provide to HPC, describe some of the important activities and early achievements in this area, and identify critical missing pieces that we as the RISC-V community should look to prioritise.</p>

    <p><strong>Bio</strong>:     <em>I am interested in the role that novel hardware can play in future supercomputers, and am specifically motivated by the grand-challenge of how we can ensure scientific programmers are able to effectively exploit such technologies without extensive hardware/architecture expertise. My research combines novel algorithmic techniques for this new hardware, programming language &amp; library design, and compilers. I coordinate knowledge exchange for the ExCALIBUR exascale software programme, and chair the RISC-V International HPC SIG. I head up EPCC’s PhD programme and am course organiser for the in-person and online Parallel Design Patterns MSc modules. I am currently undertaking a Royal Society of Edinburgh personal research fellowship.</em></p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Many RISC-V platforms and SoCs have been announced in recent years targeting the HPC sector, but only a few of them are commercially available and engineered to fit the HPC requirements. The Monte Cimone project targeted assessing their capabilities and maturity, aiming to make RISC-V a competitive choice when building a datacenter. Nowadays, RV SoCs with vector extension, form factor and memory capacity suitable for HPC applications are available in the market, but it is unclear how compilers and open-source libraries can take advantage of its performance. In this paper, we describe the performance assessment of the upgrade of the Monte Cimone (MCv2) cluster with the Sophgo SG2042 processor’s HPC operations. The upgrade increases the attained node’s performance by 127x on HPL DP FLOP/s and 69x on Stream Memory Bandwidth.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: State-of-the-art hardware countermeasures against fault attacks are based, among others, on control flow and code integrity checking. These integrities can be asserted by Generalized Path Signature Analysis and Continuous Signature Monitoring. However, supporting such mechanisms requires a dedicated compiler flow and does not support indirect jumps. In this work we propose a technique based on a hardware/software runtime to generate those signatures while executing unmodified COTS RISC-V binaries. The proposed approach has been implemented on a pipelined rv32i processor, and experimental results show an average slowdown of x1.82 compared to unprotected implementations while being completely compiler independent.</p>

    <p>T2.7.01, Wed 14 at 16:30, in Gaston Berger.</p>

    <p>By <strong>Georgi Kuzmanov</strong>, Senior Programme Officer, Chips JU.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The Chips Joint Undertaking (JU) was established in September, 2023, to implement the Chips for Europe Initiative, the first pillar of the European Chips Act and to continue the missions of its preceding joint technology initiatives in the field of electronic components and systems (ECS). For several years now, the Chips JU has been supporting two topics of common European interest, namely– Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) and RISC V based design of ECS. These two topics, initially pursued independently, have naturally converged into joint actions targeting the development of industrially significant RISC V based platforms, which support the digital Vehicle-of-the-Future (VoF) paradigm. This talk will reveal the evolution and the current state-of-play of Chips JU’s activities in the fields of SDV and RISC V. The context will be the inevitable transformation of traditional automotive industry towards digitalization to meet the global challenges in the sector.  Chips JU’s vision to employ RISC V based systems supporting SDV via hardware abstraction and consequently building a holistic digital platform for the VoF will be argued. This approach is seen as an advantageous strategic choice with significant potential impact, leading towards European technological sovereignty and more cost-efficient, thus more competitive and innovative, car manufacturing.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: We present, Flex-RV, a 32-bit microprocessor based on RISC-V instruction set fabricated with Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide (IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) on a flexible substrate, enabling an ultra-low-cost bendable microprocessor, which makes the World’s first non-silicon RISC-V microprocessor. Flex-RV integrates a programmable machine learning (ML) hardware accelerator, and demonstrates new instructions to extend the RISC-V instruction set to run ML workloads. It is implemented, fabricated and demonstrated to operate at 60 kHz consuming less than 6 mW power and its functionality when assembled onto a flexible printed circuit board is validated whilst executing programs under flat and tight bending conditions. Flex-RV pioneers an era of ultra low-cost open standard non-silicon 32-bit microprocessors for applications at Extreme Edge.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: SOCRATES is a SoC generator framework, specifically targeted at fault-tolerant architectures, developed for high-energy physics experiments, but extensible wherever high reliability is required. It allows to automatically build full SoCs starting from a collection of RISC-V CPU cores, IP blocks and interconnects. To do that, a custom build system, called SoCMake, takes care of managing dependencies and invoking the tools to generate both hardware and software components of the system. A silicon prototype has been designed and taped out to validate the toolkit and test the performance of the resulting architecture.</p>

    <p>T3.1.03 (sub. #78), Thu 15 at 09:45, in Gaston Berger.</p>

    <p>By <strong>Matthew E. Weingarten</strong>, Columbia University in the City of New York. <strong>Tanvir Ahmed Khan</strong>, University of Michigan.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Performance characterization is the key to unlocking efficient utilization of the underlying processing system. Rapid developments in specialized computing and hardware/software co-design make performance characterization more challenging—as the underlying hardware changes, so must the performance monitoring hardware and the accompanying performance models. CPU vendors have successfully popularized the top-down micro-architectural analysis (TMA) methodology that is effective in identifying true bottlenecks in a processor while abstracting away the hardware implementation. Unfortunately, researchers and practitioners are often limited to open-source RISC-V processors that lack hardware support for TMA or any other systematic performance characterization methodology. Even the simple scalar in-order RocketCore has not implemented performance hardware capable of providing enough information to support TMA, let alone more complex Out-of-Order (OoO) and super scalar SonicBOOM core. Furthermore, the challenges of performance characterization are compounded by the ever-increasing heterogeneity and specialization of hardware, and a wholistic performance characterization methodology for an entire System-on-Chip (SoC) remains open-ended. Overall, the lack of hardware-supported performance characterization hamstrings the ability to evaluate new hardware designs, for performance tooling to adapt to modern hardware, or even programmers efficiently exploit the target hardware.</p>

    <p>By <strong>Oana Alexandra Lazar</strong>, Tessent Embedded Analytics. <strong>Henrique Mendes</strong>, Tessent Embedded Analytics. <strong>Angelo Maldonado-Liu</strong>, Tessent Embedded Analytics.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The development risks of novel RISC-V solutions are exacerbated by bugs which are increasingly complicated to root-cause in ever-larger and more complex systems. Current debugging solutions are intrusive, impacting program execution timing and potentially hiding Heisenbugs. Run-stop-step debuggers alone lack the depth of visibility needed to root-cause complex and timing-sensitive bugs. We propose a complete end-to-end solution for highly efficient tracing, minimally invasive logging, and accelerated run-stop-step debugging of any RISC-V system, with out-of-the-box support for custom instructions. We demonstrate that an approach using both hardware and software to their full extent increases the efficiency of RISC-V debug and trace.</p>

    <p>By <strong>Luke Lau</strong>, Igalia. <strong>Alex Bradbury</strong>, Igalia.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: LLVM has had stable support for the RISC-V vector extension for the past several releases, with both forms of autovectorization – the loop vectorizer and the SLP (superword-level-parallelism) vectorizer – enabled by default, as well as a rich set of C intrinsics for the RVV programming model. A key focus since then has been on improving generated code performance. This submission explains the changes made in the middle-end and backend that have delivered these gains and looks ahead to future work.</p>

    <p>By <strong>Lucana Santos</strong>, Microelectronics Engineer, ESA.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: RISC-V in space is becoming a tangible reality, with several missions already flying it. This presentation highlights the European Space Agency (ESA) latest developments to advance the adoption of this open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) in space systems. The portfolio of RISC-V centred System-on-Chip (SoC) for space is growing, with new devices soon going to be manufactured and offered in the market. Such SoCs bring unique space-related features as well as technical and programmatical challenges, which are presented in this talk. RISC-V in space is further supported by ESA by promoting the design and implementation of high-performance, reliable IP cores, and the establishment of a robust software ecosystem. In addition, the Ultra Deep Submicron (UDSM) initiative will be presented, showing how advanced semiconductor technology development is further accelerating the integration of RISC-V into space-grade electronics. These advancements will enable future space missions and projects to fully leverage the benefits of an open, flexible, and scalable ISA, fostering innovation, reducing dependency on proprietary technologies, and enhancing long-term sustainability in the space industry.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Debugging program misbehaviour that impacts large scale deployment of highly connected systems requires a robust debug infrastructure to monitor the instructions, data, and transactions between system components. The rapid adoption of RISC-V processors in mission critical applications has compelled system designers to rely on embedded trace monitors based on the RISC-V E-Trace specification to collect instruction trace data to analyse the trajectory of the transactions involving the CPU, memory, I/Os, peripherals, and other sub-systems. In this paper we describe a highly efficient software E-Trace Decoder that allows trace data to be non-intrusively captured at-speed. We describe two case studies to highlight the power of this implementation and provide quantitative data to show the efficiency of this implementation.</p>

    <p>By <strong>Trevor Gamblin</strong>, BayLibre Inc. <strong>Mark D. Ryan</strong>, Rivos Inc. <strong>Julien Stephan</strong>, BayLibre Inc..</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: As the RISC-V ecosystem grows with new platforms and higher performance, a key area of interest is its
applicability towards scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning. On other architectures such
as ARM, these areas are already well-supported thanks to broad availability of binaries for critical packages
such as NumPy, pandas, and PyTorch, but with RISC-V these are largely unavailable. The problem is further
compounded by the challenge of building such packages manually, where even foundational examples such as
NumPy take a prohibitively long time to build from source on commonly-available hardware, in addition to being
prone to build errors and dependency chains that lead to long hours of sorting through confusing stack traces.
The RISE project is tackling this problem by building, testing, deploying, and maintaining binaries for a selection
of these packages. This creates a path forward for developers that wish to leverage current and upcoming RISC-V
platforms for specialized research and industry applications</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: As computational paradigms evolve, applications such as attention-based models, wireless telecommunications, and computer vision impose increasingly challenging requirements on computer architectures: significant memory footprints and computing resources are demanded while maintaining flexibility and programmability at a low power budget.
Thanks to their advantageous trade-offs, shared-L1-memory clusters have become a common building block of massively parallel computing architectures tackling these issues.
MemPool is an open-source, RISC-V-based manycore cluster scaling up to 1024 processing elements (PEs). MemPool offers a scalable, extensible, and programmable solution to the challenges of shared-L1 clusters, establishing itself as an open-source research platform for architectural variants covering a wide trade-off space between versatility and performance. As a demonstration, this paper compares the three main MemPool flavors, Baseline MemPool, Systolic MemPool, and Vectorial MemPool, detailing their architecture, targets, and achieved trade-offs.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This contribution explores possible improvements on GCC code generation for RISC-V. We collected dynamic instruction counts from selected SPEC CPU 2017 benchmarks and compared the results with AArch64. Findings reveal that prominent compiler weaknesses include missed unrolling opportunities, extra move instructions and suboptimal register allocation. Additionally, addressing ISA limitations, such as the lack of a scaled addressing mode, and vectorising library functions, like memset and math operations, are crucial for maximising RISC-V efficiency.</p>

Gaston Berger.</p>

    <p>Moderated by <strong>Isaac Chute</strong>, Director of Software Ecosystem, RISC-V International.</p>

    <p><strong>Argument</strong>: While building an open ISA is revolutionizing silicon development across Europe and the world at large, it needs to work hand in hand with the software ecosystem for it to be truly impactful in the marketplace. Europe is home to several centers of excellence within the Linux software distribution space. SUSE is based in the heart of Europe. Canonical too has it’s headquarters there. While Red Hat has its largest global engineering base in Brno, Česká republika. In essence a major portion of Open Source software development is driven from within the confines of Europe. Each of the major Enterprise Linux Distributions is investing in the enablement of the RISC-V platform, in essence collaborating in joint upstream development. Open Source is all about community where competitors collaborate to enable the future of tomorrow. Here is our chance to hear directly from the major Enterprise Distributions about their investment into this new and exciting future of the RISC-V software ecosystem which will drive technological innovation for decades to come.</p>

    <h3 id="opentitan-integrated-a-risc-v-open-source-silicon-root-of-trust-for-large-socs">OpenTitan Integrated: A RISC-V Open-Source Silicon Root-of-Trust for large SoCs</h3>

    <p>T3.7.02 (sub. #221), Thu 15 at 16:45, in Gaston Berger.</p>

    <p>By <strong>Robert Schilling</strong>, Rivos Inc.. <strong>Samuel Ortiz</strong>, Rivos Inc.. <strong>Ravi Sahita</strong>, Rivos Inc.. <strong>Andreas Kurth</strong>, Lowrisc CIC.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Modern System-on-Chips (SoCs) rely on a secure Root of Trust (RoT) as the foundation for all security services. Compromise of the RoT can have catastrophic consequences, undermining the security of the entire system.</p>

    <p>This paper presents OpenTitan Integrated, an open-source silicon RoT based on RISC-V specifically tailored for integration into the complex security subsystems of large SoCs. OpenTitan Integrated extends the functionality of the discrete OpenTitan implementation by addressing the specific needs of integrated deployments. Key contributions include: 1) a clear interface trust boundary, defining secure communication paths and preventing privilege escalation; 2) a robust and standardized communication interface, enabling seamless interaction with other SoC components; and 3) a flexible register isolation mechanism, protecting sensitive registers in the system from unauthorized access and modification. These additions enable secure interaction with other SoC components and prevent unauthorized access, enhancing the overall security posture of the SoC.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, OpenTitan Integrated’s open-source nature, available on GitHub under a permissive license, facilitates community review, independent verification, and enhances the overall security and trustworthiness of the design. This collaborative approach allows for rapid identification and mitigation of potential vulnerabilities, leading to a more robust and secure RoT.</p>

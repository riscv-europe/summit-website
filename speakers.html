<p><em>Abstract</em></p>
<p>Today’s data-parallel workloads in HPC, AI, IoT demand ever-growing performance under an (almost) constant power envelope. To address this fundamental challenge in a regime of diminishing returns from technology scaling, we must minimize overhead associated with data transfer, data-flow management, as well as instruction fetching, decoding, while introducing “controlled doses” of domain specialization. The last decade has seen the rise of open instruction sets, open architectures, and open hardware as key enablers for designing more efficient computing systems. In this talk, I share insights gained in a decade of design adventures on open-source RISC-V hardware and software for energy-efficient computing, moving from tiny, parallel ultra-low power chips to high-performance many-core chiplets, and provide a personal view on future directions.</p>

<p><em>Luca Benini holds the chair of digital Circuits and systems at ETHZ and is Full Professor at the Universita’ di Bologna. He received a PhD from Stanford University. Dr. Benini’s research interests are in energy-efficient parallel computing systems, smart sensing micro-systems and machine learning hardware. He is a Fellow of the IEEE, of the ACM and a member of the Academia Europaea. He is the recipient of the 2016 IEEE CAS Mac Van Valkenburg award, the 2020 EDAA achievement Award, the 2020 ACM/IEEE A. Richard Newton Award and the 2023 IEEE CS Edward J. McCluskey award.</em></p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The European Space Agency, in a long tradition, is promoting the use of open Instruction Set Architectures (ISA). The SPARC ISA had been selected more than 25 years ago, mainly for two reasons: Firstly, because it is an open specification, warranting our non-dependence by allowing us to develop our own IP, avoiding court cases with a copyright owner. Secondly because of its significant backing from the commercial world, ensuring availability of compilers etc. Several generations of SPARC microprocessors have been developed for space, many thousands of parts used on satellites and rockets. Today, SPARC is obsolete in academia and in the commercial world, there are no more young developers coming from universities, maintaining SW tools and OS is becoming a burden for our small space community.</p>
<p>RISC-V is an open ISA, like SPARC, but thanks to the rapidly growing developer community, active standardization, a wide choice of IP providers and its scalability, it is the preferred choice to replace SPARC in space. While the existing microprocessors continue to be supported by their suppliers, ESA recommends the space community to standardize on RISC-V across the full range of applications, from microcontroller to High Performance Computing (HPC).</p>
<p>The talk will introduce the efforts introducing RISC-V to space and highlight some of the challenges encountered when developing microprocessors for space. Radiation effects and reliability requirements must be considered, but constraints exist also on the organisational and commercial side, space being a niche market with a small developer community and long product life cycles.</p>
<p><em>Bio</em></p>
<p>Graduated 1993 in Electrical Engineering and Semiconductor Physics from Ecole Supérieure d’Electricité (“Supélec”) in Paris / France. Worked as digital ASIC designer for Infineon in Munich and Tel Aviv in various consumer electronics projects (e.g. TV frame rate converter, DSL modem) dealing with integration of embedded DRAM and DSP cores. Joined the European Space Agency (ESA) in 2000 as a Microelectronics Engineer. In charge of various IC development projects, a predominant topic are standard microprocessors and SoC’s built around microprocessor cores, as well as radiation-hard design methodology.</p>

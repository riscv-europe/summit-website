## Core Conference Speakers

The core of the conference will be from Tuesday 6th to Thursday 8th
with a single track of keynotes, invited and selected talks, alongside
an exhibition showcasing the latest developments across industry and
research.

The following speakers will be delivering keynotes and regular talks
during these three days.

**Abstract**

Today's data-parallel workloads in HPC, AI, IoT demand ever-growing
performance under an (almost) constant power envelope. To address this
fundamental challenge in a regime of diminishing returns from
technology scaling, we must minimize overhead associated with data
transfer, data-flow management, as well as instruction fetching,
decoding, while introducing "controlled doses" of domain
specialization. The last decade has seen the rise of open instruction
sets, open architectures, and open hardware as key enablers for
designing more efficient computing systems. In this talk, I share
insights gained in a decade of design adventures on open-source RISC-V
hardware and software for energy-efficient computing, moving from
tiny, parallel ultra-low power chips to high-performance many-core
chiplets, and provide a personal view on future directions.

**Abstract**

The European Space Agency, in a long tradition, is promoting the use
of open Instruction Set Architectures (ISA). The SPARC ISA had been
selected more than 25 years ago, mainly for two reasons: Firstly,
because it is an open specification, warranting our non-dependence by
allowing us to develop our own IP, avoiding court cases with a
copyright owner. Secondly because of its significant backing from the
commercial world, ensuring availability of compilers etc. Several
generations of SPARC microprocessors have been developed for space,
many thousands of parts used on satellites and rockets. Today, SPARC
is obsolete in academia and in the commercial world, there are no more
young developers coming from universities, maintaining SW tools and OS
is becoming a burden for our small space community.

RISC-V is an open ISA, like SPARC, but thanks to the rapidly growing
developer community, active standardization, a wide choice of IP
providers and its scalability, it is the preferred choice to replace
SPARC in space. While the existing microprocessors continue to be
supported by their suppliers, ESA recommends the space community to
standardize on RISC-V across the full range of applications, from
microcontroller to High Performance Computing (HPC).

The talk will introduce the efforts introducing RISC-V to space and
highlight some of the challenges encountered when developing
microprocessors for space. Radiation effects and reliability
requirements must be considered, but constraints exist also on the
organisational and commercial side, space being a niche market with a
small developer community and long product life cycles.

Graduated 1993 in Electrical Engineering and Semiconductor Physics
from Ecole Supérieure d’Electricité (“Supélec”) in Paris /
France. Worked as digital ASIC designer for Infineon in Munich and Tel
Aviv in various consumer electronics projects (e.g. TV frame rate
converter, DSL modem) dealing with integration of embedded DRAM and
DSP cores. Joined the European Space Agency (ESA) in 2000 as a
Microelectronics Engineer. In charge of various IC development
projects, a predominant topic are standard microprocessors and SoC’s
built around microprocessor cores, as well as radiation-hard design
methodology.

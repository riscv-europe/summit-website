The RISC-V Summit Europe will be the premier event that connects the European movers and shakers - from industry, government, research, academia and ecosystem support - that are building the future of innovation on RISC-V.

RISC-V, the open standard [instruction set architecture (ISA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture), is enabling a range of new applications and research that will define the future of computing in Europe. The region has been central to RISC-V’s success, with one-third of RISC-V’s global community based in Europe.

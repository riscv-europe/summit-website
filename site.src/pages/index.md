The *RISC-V Summit Europe* will be the premier event that connects the European movers and shakers - from industry, government, research, academia and ecosystem support - that are building the future of innovation on RISC-V.

RISC-V, the open standard [instruction set architecture (ISA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture), is enabling a range of new applications and research that will define the future of computing in Europe. The region has been central to RISC-V’s success, with one-third of RISC-V’s global community based in Europe.

*RISC-V Summit Europe* takes place from Monday 5th to Friday 9th June. The combination of  strong industrial and academic communities is key to the success of RISC-V in Europe, and for this reason the conference is designed to help attendees to explore both commercial and research applications.

Monday June 5th afternoon is dedicated to Technical Working Group (TWG) meetings, and Friday to workshops for projects related to RISC-V and open computing.

The main body of the conference takes place from Tuesday 6th to Thursday 8th, comprising a single track of keynotes, invited and selected talks, alongside an exhibition showcasing the latest developments across industry and research. The exhibition features stands from member companies and other contributers, a demo theatre for further talks, and poster sessions. Special focus will paid to critical European markets such as automotive, high performance computing and data center, aerospace, embedded, AI/ML, security and more.

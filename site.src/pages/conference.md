### Brett Cline -- RISC-V Customization, HW/SW Co-Optimization, and Custom Compute

*Plenary on Tue 6th at 11:45.*
*Link: [slides](media/proceedings/plenary/2023-06-06-11h45-Brett-CLINE-slides.pdf).*

[Brett Cline](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brett-cline/) -- CCO, [Codasip](https://codasip.com/)

**Abstract**

If you optimize your software for a general-purpose core there is a
substantial risk that your algorithms are executed inefficiently and
therefore run slowly. You can address this by creating fixed-function
circuits designed to perform a specific set of operations. These
hardware functions can be extremely fast, but because they are hard
coded, it is difficult to modify or update them. So how can you
achieve flexibility and performance? By combining both approaches. A
key benefit of RISC-V customization is that you can create custom
instructions tailored to your specific application needs.

To pick custom instructions correctly and create efficient
implementations, software and hardware teams need to collaborate. By
starting work earlier on processor customization, the software team
can start developing their critical algorithms and uncover much sooner
those potential gains that could not be achieved if the hardware was
already frozen.   We call this Custom Compute, and its benefits extend
beyond performance and energy efficiency. Custom Compute can also
enable organizations to improve security by adding security features
at the heart of the processor. A closer collaboration between hardware
and software teams, supported by a strong methodology and by efficient
tools, is the future standard of system design.

### Michael Gielda -- RISC-V and Antmicro’s visual system designer: Everything everywhere all at once

*Plenary on Tue 6th at 14:15.*

[Michael Gielda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgielda/) -- Co-Founder and VP Business Development, [Antmicro](https://antmicro.com/).

**Abstract**

RISC-V offers unprecedented freedom in designing hardware systems,
prompting a renaissance in new core implementations, system building
blocks and SW-HW co-design paradigms. Drawing on the experience of
working with the expansive landscape of RISC-V implementations, both
on the hardware and software level, Antmicro is developing a visual
platform designer which helps navigate this complexity. The tool
builds on the configurability of RISC-V and the our vast open source
database of hardware components to let you create advanced, real-world
systems which can be simulated with the open source Renode simulator
and seeded with software such as Zephyr or Linux.

Thanks to Renode’s support for vector and custom instructions and
integration with Google’s IREE toolchain through Antmicro’s Kenning ML
framework, the designer is also a great entrypoint for
hardware-accelerated ML co-design, and combined with Antmicro’s
photorealistic 3D component model library and open source HW design
methodology it can be used to kickstart the development of custom
RISC-V based devices.

Combine cores and HW peripherals, SoCs, modules and other hardware
components, all the way to heterogeneous connected systems to build,
simulate and develop software for any kind of RISC-V platform. The
transparency and flexibility of this comprehensive design paradigm
will provide infinite possibilities for collecting both hardware and
software data for efficient co-design

*Bio*

*Michael Gielda is Co-Founder and VP Business Development at Antmicro,
Marketing Committee Chair of the Zephyr Project, Chair of Outreach for

### Franck Bernard -- The RISC-V opportunity in Automotive Electronics

Franck Bernard, System and Innovation - ADAS & Driving Assistance - IC Design and SW development, Bosch.

*Plenary on Tue 6th at 16:30.*
*Link: [slides](media/proceedings/plenary/2023-06-06-16h30-Franck-BERNARD-slides.pdf).*

**Abstract**

A digital transformation of the car is currently taking place, driven
by powertrain electrification, increased levels of autonomy, new
in-car experiences and the trend towards the Software-defined
vehicle. The automotive supply chain is looking for the computing
architectures that can deliver this future.

In this talk, we will examine the opportunity that Bosch sees in the
RISC-V ISA and how it can be applied to future automotive
challenges. We will detail architectural trends and the move from
distributed to domain-centralized and then vehicle-centralized
compute. The processing needs of the different in-car processing
modules will be discussed, including performance requirements and the
range of cores that will be required.

We will discuss the benefits that the RISC-V architecture can bring to

### Pannel -- Collaboration and Culture: Leveraging Diverse Strengths to Cultivate a Stronger Community

*Plenary on Wed 7th at 08:00.*

**Topic**

It takes a global community to bring out the best of an open standard.

So how do we tap into and embrace the diversity of the ecosystem to
strengthen solutions around RISC-V? RISC-V is a global standard, so it
requires groups around the world to find ways to bring together
individuals with different skillsets and experience, in different
stages in their careers, from various industries, or across different
regions, and channeling their strengths to make RISC-V the standard
for open computing. From projects in Europe that pull together members
across industry, academia and research, to individuals that need to
rally resources across a nation or a university, here's a chance to
hear from members of the global community on how they address
culture. create high-performing groups and collaborate to get the most
out of their teams.

### Luca Benini -- Open RISC-V Platforms for Energy-Efficient, Scalable Computing

*Plenary on Wed 7th at 09:00.*

[Luca Benini](https://pulp-platform.org) -- [ETH
Zürich](https://ee.ethz.ch/the-department/people-a-z/person-detail.luca-benini.html),
[Università di Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/luca.benini).

**Abstract**

Today's data-parallel workloads in HPC, AI, IoT demand ever-growing
performance under an (almost) constant power envelope. To address this
fundamental challenge in a regime of diminishing returns from
technology scaling, we must minimize overhead associated with data
transfer, data-flow management, as well as instruction fetching,
decoding, while introducing "controlled doses" of domain
specialization. The last decade has seen the rise of open instruction
sets, open architectures, and open hardware as key enablers for
designing more efficient computing systems. In this talk, I share
insights gained in a decade of design adventures on open-source RISC-V
hardware and software for energy-efficient computing, moving from
tiny, parallel ultra-low power chips to high-performance many-core
chiplets, and provide a personal view on future directions.

### Dave Ditzel -- RISC-V’s revolutionary role for simultaneously supporting machine learning and HPC

*Plenary on Wed 7th at 12:00.*

Dave Ditzel, Esperanto Technologies.

**Abstract**

High-end computing is undergoing revolutionary change. After many
years of most high-end computers being used to serve web pages, the
last decade saw a remarkable growth in the use of machine
learning. Separately, HPC computers continued to grow peak flop rates,
but system design was largely constrained to x86 server CPUs coupled
with GPU accelerators. The thesis of this presentation is that the
rise of generative-AI system is the final tipping point that will push
for merged ML/HPC system design, and that RISC-V is well positioned to
be able to take a leading role in this revolution.

*Bio*

*A well-known entrepreneur and visionary in the computer and
semiconductor industry, Dave was founder and CEO of Transmeta, maker
of low power x86 microprocessors, raising over $600M from startup to a
$6B IPO. Dave co-authored “The Case for RISC,” along with professor
David Patterson. Previously, Dave was a vice president at Intel
Corporation, leading advanced processor projects, and CTO at Sun
Microsystems for the SPARC Technology Business. After earning a degree
in Electrical Engineering and a separate degree in Computer Science,
Dave did his graduate work at U.C. Berkeley under professor David
Patterson.*

**Abstract**

TRISTAN is a European KDT cooperation project which started in
December 2022 and runs for 3 years.  The overarching aim is to expand,
mature and industrialize the European RISC-V ecosystem so that it is
able to compete with existing commercial alternatives. This will be
achieved by leveraging the Open-Source community to gain in
productivity and quality. This goal will be achieved by defining a
European strategy for RISC-V based designs including the creation of a
repository of industrial quality building blocks to be used for SoC
designs in different application domains (e.g. automotive, industrial,
etc.). The TRISTAN approach is holistic, covering both electronic
design automation tools (EDA) and the full software stack. The TRISTAN
consortium is composed of 46 partners from industry (both large
industries as well as SMEs), research organizations, universities and
RISC-V related industry associations, originating from Austria,
Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands,
Poland, Romania, Turkey and Switzerland.  The presentation will focus
on some of the specific targets and expected results of the project
and how this fits in the Europen RISC-V Open-Source Roadmap which was
developed by a European Working Group and is documented in a report:
[``Recommendations and roadmap for European sovereignty on open source
hardware, software and RISC-V Technologies | Shaping Europe’s digital

### Karol Gugala & Matt Cockrell -- Enabling Collaborative Chip Design in the RISC-V VeeR core and Caliptra RoT Project with CHIPS Alliance tools

*Plenary on Wed 7th at 14:30.*

[Karol Gugala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karol-gugala-056313aa/) -- Engineering Manager, [Antmicro](https://antmicro.com/) and Matt Cockrell -- Hardware Engineer, Google

**Abstract**

Building a modern, complex, RISC-V based digital design like the
Caliptra Root of Trust requires collaborative effort between multiple
development teams of various backgrounds, especially in
standards-based multi-organization environments like CHIPS
Alliance. While in software development massive, standards-driven
collaboration is a reality through open source infrastructure and
tools, the digital design space often lacks the open source tooling
needed to easily share and automate workflows, scale continuous
integration and enable security through transparency of the
development process. In this paper, we will describe how digital
design tools and workflows developed by CHIPS Alliance are being used
in practice in a collaborative environment as a potential template for
other work in this space.

*Bio*

**Abstract**

The ongoing development and maturation of RISC-V LLVM support has been
a major success story for RISC-V software ecosystem enablement through
cross-party collaboration. This talk will bring you up to date on the
current status of that effort (both for scalar and vector instruction
set extensions), highlighting some of the more interesting challenges
along the way. Looking to the future, we'll explore how the nature of
LLVM development for RISC-V is changing as support for the standard
ratified extensions matures, more hardware reaches the market, and as
RISC-V support is added for additional LLVM project tools and
sub-projects beyond the backend and the Clang C/C++ frontend.

### Roland Weigand -- RISC-V: a Rising Star in Space

Roland Weigand -- [European Space Agency (ESA)](https://www.esa.int).

*Plenary on Thu 8th at 14:00.*

**Abstract**

The European Space Agency, in a long tradition, is promoting the use
of open Instruction Set Architectures (ISA). The SPARC ISA had been
selected more than 25 years ago, mainly for two reasons: Firstly,
because it is an open specification, warranting our non-dependence by
allowing us to develop our own IP, avoiding court cases with a
copyright owner. Secondly because of its significant backing from the
commercial world, ensuring availability of compilers etc. Several
generations of SPARC microprocessors have been developed for space,
many thousands of parts used on satellites and rockets. Today, SPARC
is obsolete in academia and in the commercial world, there are no more
young developers coming from universities, maintaining SW tools and OS
is becoming a burden for our small space community.

RISC-V is an open ISA, like SPARC, but thanks to the rapidly growing
developer community, active standardization, a wide choice of IP
providers and its scalability, it is the preferred choice to replace
SPARC in space. While the existing microprocessors continue to be
supported by their suppliers, ESA recommends the space community to
standardize on RISC-V across the full range of applications, from
microcontroller to High Performance Computing (HPC).

The talk will introduce the efforts introducing RISC-V to space and
highlight some of the challenges encountered when developing
microprocessors for space. Radiation effects and reliability
requirements must be considered, but constraints exist also on the
organisational and commercial side, space being a niche market with a
small developer community and long product life cycles.

### Karol Gugala -- Bare metal AI runtime deployment and analysis for a RISC-V accelerator with Kenning, Renode and IREE

[Karol Gugala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karol-gugala-056313aa/) -- Engineering Manager, [Antmicro](https://antmicro.com/).

**Abstract**

Thanks to their increasing computational capabilities and the open ISA’ s ability to tailor silicon to specific use cases, RISC-V based microcontroller devices are an interesting target for Machine Learning workflows in low-power applications. To make the best of the constrained resources of MCUs, Antmicro’s Kenning open source AI/ML framework was extended with a bare-metal runtime backend, enabling use with RISC-V based devices that cannot - or don’t need to - run Linux. Kenning enables you to seamlessly develop, train, optimize and deploy ML models on various embedded targets and can automatically convert the model format between the most popular AI frameworks and optimize models for their target runtime. The metrics from the deployed models can be utilized to monitor various aspects of processing, from machine resource usage to result quality.

To further improve the developer experience, Kenning has been integrated with Renode, Antmicro’s open source, deterministic simulation framework. The integration of Kenning and Renode enables a hardware-less development flow and allows for complete insight into model execution and AI accelerator utilization. Renode provides a fully automated, reproducible execution environment, allowing a CI-based development of embedded models, optimization libraries, and AI accelerators. The demo will present a complete ML model deployment flow based on Kenning, targeting Google's Springbok RISC-V AI accelerator and leveraging the RISC-V Vector Extension, fully simulated in Renode.

**Abstract**

Digital chip designers face a significant challenge when it comes to integrating the necessary analog circuitry to support their SoC designs. They can experience difficulties in obtaining appropriate analog IP for specific processes and foundries, and struggle with the integration of multiple analog IP blocks from different vendors into their systems. The integration of analog and digital at the mixed-signal boundary poses a particularly daunting and resource-intensive task, requiring specialized knowledge and tools.
To address these challenges, Agile Analog present an innovative analog IP subsystem for RISC-V applications. This subsystem is designed to be customizable, and digitally wrapped, offering a novel solution that tackles many of the issues encountered by SoC designers with existing solutions. Specifically, Agile Analog's subsystem includes a comprehensive set of analog IP components essential for a typical battery-powered IoT system, including a power management unit (PMU), a sleep management unit (SMU), and data converters. These IP components undergo thorough verification in both analog and digital environments, ensuring their reliability and performance, plus seamlessly connect to the MCU's peripheral bus and are supplied with a SystemVerilog model, facilitating their integration into an existing SoC's verification environment.

### Simon Davidmann -- RISC-V Models for Verification, Software Development and Architectural Exploration

Jon Taylor -- Director of Product Technology, [Imperas Software Ltd.](https://www.imperas.com/).

**Abstract**

The design freedoms of RISC-V offer systems and SoC developers new flexibility to optimize a processor for the requirements of the target application. Now Architectural Exploration is not just about the configuration of multi-core designs, but the analysis of the application and potential advantages of custom instructions. Custom extension can boost the performance for a target class of operations, or support new multi-core communication methods. Software development with virtual prototypes is well established, but new to RISC-V is the advantage of these platforms offer to end users migrating legacy applications to the new RISC-V based device, well before silicon is available. For SoC teams optimizing a RISC-V processor they also need to address the additional challenge of RISC-V verification, open standards such as The RISC-V Verification Interface (RVVI) are helping the ecosystem support for standards-based test benches and Verification IP. This talk highlights the RISC-V models that are unifying the hardware, software, and verification teams across all phases of RISC-V projects with dependable quality and efficiency.

### Zdenek Prikryl -- RISC-V as an enabler of heterogeneous compute

[Zdenek Prikryl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zdenek-prikryl/) -- CTO, [Codasip](https://codasip.com/).

**Abstract**

The semiconductor industry has benefited from shrinking process nodes to improve performance while reducing cost and power for many years. But this no longer holds. We can’t rely on smaller silicon geometries to achieve computational improvements. Instead, we are in a world where performance, power, and cost benefits must come from the architecture and from custom compute. With many possible specialized processor architectures, processor design automation is essential to ensure that design cycles are short and cost effective. In this demo, we will go through some examples that show how RISC-V designs are customized for computational workloads in different domains using a single, unified toolchain for processor design automation.

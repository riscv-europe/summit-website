## Side Events Details

### EU Pilot CM

Private meeting: **EU Pilot Consortium Meeting**.


### EU Pilot WS

Open workshop: **EU Pilot Public Workshop**.


### Orshin

Open workshop: **ORSHIN -- Open-source ReSilient Hardware and software for Internet of thiNgs.**

The primary goal of the ORSHIN project is to create a generic and
holistic methodology, which we call the ‘trusted life cycle’ to
develop and manage connected devices based on open-source hardware.
We identified a chain of six essential phases: Design, Implementation,
Evaluation, Installation, Maintenance, and Retirement. The life cycle
will specify how to translate abstract security goals (e.g., build a
secure IoT product) into security policies for the phases, and further
into concrete security requirements for the building blocks of the
product (e.g., use 128-bit keys). More: <https://horizon-orshin.eu>

Participation in the WS itself is free of charge, but
[registration](registration.html) for the *Friday 9 Side Events* is
required to cover the costs of breaks and lunch.

### RISER WS

Open workshop: **RISC-V for Cloud Services.**

What is missing, if anything, for RISC-V to become a viable choice for
Cloud services?

This workshop aims to facilitate a critical examination of this
question, with particular focus on relevant developments within
Europe.

Invited speakers will provide an up-to-date outlook on the RISC-V
ecosystem and its rapid evolution, covering standardization
developments as well as ongoing research and innovation activities
within Europe, particularly from a set of concurrently running
projects funded by the EU under the proposal call on “Open source for
cloud-based services”. The workshop will also host a panel to elicit
further insights and concrete action lines for further enhancements of
RISC-V technology in support of Cloud services.

Web site: [RISER project](https://riser-project.eu).
Mail: [Workshop RISER 2023](mailto:riser-workshop23@ics.forth.gr).

Participation in the WS itself is free of charge, but
[registration](registration.html) for the *Friday 9 Side Events* is

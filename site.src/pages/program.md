## Call for Submissions

RISC-V Summit Europe brings together developers, architects, technical
decision and policy makers from across the European RISC-V
ecosystem. Attendees from academia, research, SMEs, industry, and open
source communities will come together to exchange knowledge, ideas,
technologies, and research shaping the future of RISC-V computing in
Europe.

The event will have a single track of keynotes, invited and selected
talks alongside an exhibition showcasing the latest developments
across industry and research, including technology demonstrations and
poster sessions.  We invite blind submissions of **extended abstracts** related to RISC-V
addressing the following technical topics of interest:

 - Automotive 
 - Cloud computing
 - Compilation and code optimization
 - Embedded systems, IoT, edge computing
 - Hardware/software co-design
 - High-performance computing
 - Open EDA tools
 - Open-source hardware and open silicon
 - Operating system and software ecosystem 
 - RISC-V related educational activities
 - RISC-V ISA extensions
 - Systems-on-Chip, including processor cores, accelerators, peripherals
 - Security and functional safety 
 - Verification
 - Any other topic related to RISC-V and open hardware

We also welcome non-blind submissions related to:

 - Commercial applications for real world deployment
 - Policies, strategies, business and industry trends
 - Publicly funded projects presentations and/or results

Submissions on technical topics are for blind review. Please do not
include author information in the extended abstract. Submissions must have a
strong focus on technical content outlining for example:

 - Present research advances 
 - Success stories 
 - Technical introduction to new technologies or products
 - Experiences of contributions to, or adoption of RISC-V hardware and software in commercial, open-source or education environments 

The PC may ask for the poster/presentation three weeks before the
event to confirm the acceptance.

<h3  id="guidelines-for-non-blind-topic-submissions">Guidelines for non-blind topic submissions</h3>

These papers should highlight RISC-V markets, policies, strategies,
business and industry trends, or present publicly funded projects of
interest to the RISC-V and open hardware community.

For these topics, make sure to name authors and their affiliation and
include a short bio of all in the two pages extended abstract.

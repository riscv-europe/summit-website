## RISC-V International WG Meetings

Reminder: *to attend RISC-V International TWG meetings*, a [personal
or corporate membership](https://riscv.org/membership) is required.


### Security HC

The main goals of the *Security Horizontal Committee* are:

 - Promote RISC-V as an ideal vehicle for the security community
 - Liaise with other internal RISC V committees and with external
   security committees
 - Create an information repository on new attack trends, threats and
   countermeasures
 - Identify top 10 open challenges in security for the RISC-V
   community to address
 - Propose security committees (Marketing or Technical) to tackle
   specific security topics
 - Recruit security talent to the RISC-V ecosystem (e.g., into
   committees)
 - Develop consensus around best security practices for IoT devices
   and embedded systems

More info at <https://lists.riscv.org/g/security>.


### RVM-CSI

The *RISC-V Common Software Interface (RVM-CSI) Special Interest Group
(SIG)* drives the strategy and coordinates the development of RISC-V’s
Common Software Interface (CSI) for RISC-V Microcontrollers.

More info at <https://lists.riscv.org/g/sig-rvm-csi>.


### Code Size

The *Code Size Reduction TG* will develop a holistic solution to
reducing code size, covering different profiles to be competitive with
other core implementations of other architectures of a similar class.

Priority is given to small embedded cores which often have very
constrained memory sizes and so code size reduction is most important
for cost reduction. Larger/higher performance cores will also benefit
from reduced code size.

More info at <https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-code-size>.


### Cryptographic Extensions TG

The *Cryptographic Extensions Task Group* will propose ISA extensions
to the vector extensions for the standardized and secure execution of
popular cryptography algorithms.  To ensure that processor
implementers are able to support a wide range of performance and
security levels the committee will create a base and an extended
specification. The base will be comprised of low-cost instructions
that are useful for the acceleration of common algorithms. The
extended specification will include greater functionality, reserve
encodings for more algorithms, and will facilitate improved security
of execution and higher performance.  The scope will include symmetric
and asymmetric cryptographic algorithms and related primitives such as
message digests.

The committee will also make ISA extension proposals for lightweight
scalar instructions for 32 and 64 bit machines that improve the
performance and reduce the code size required for software execution
of common algorithms like AES and SHA and lightweight algorithms like
PRESENT and GOST, as well as ISA proposals regarding the use of random
bits and secure key management.

More info at <https://wiki.riscv.org/display/HOME/Cryptographic+Extensions+TG>.


### Post-Quantum Cryptography

The *Post-Quantum Cryptography* explore and recommend RISC-V
Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Extensions that enhance performance
and implementation efficiency for contemporary public-key
cryptography, with a focus on standard Post-Quantum Cryptography
algorithms like Kyber, Dilithium, and others.

More info at <https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-pqc-cryptography>.


### Architectural Compatibility Test SIG

The *Architectural Compatibility Test SIG* defines coverage
requirements for RV32I compliance tests, release compliance test
format spec, release compliance suite for RV32I.

More info at <https://lists.riscv.org/g/sig-arch-test>.


### Automotive SIG

The *Automotive SIG* provides a global forum for technical and
strategic input into activities enabling or accelerating adoption of
RISC-V related technology in the Automotive industry.

More info at <https://lists.riscv.org/g/sig-automotive>.


### Floating-Point SIG

The *Floating Point (FP) SIG* will manage the existing FP formats and
evaluate emerging formats for inclusion in the RISC-V architecture.

More info at <https://lists.riscv.org/g/sig-fp>.


### ACT Plans and Challenges

(TBD).


### RISC-V Academic and Training Special Interest Group

Join academics and industry to connect on how to better support
professors and students in teaching and learning RISC-V.

The mission of the *Academic and Training Special Interest Group* is
to promote RISC-V as a common platform based on an open ISA. The group
supports educators and students with resources to further their
education on all levels of the hardware and software stack, using the
RISC-V ecosystem of solutions. The group's aim is to increase adoption
of RISC-V to prepare computer and electronic engineers for the
challenges and opportunities of the future.

More info at <https://lists.riscv.org/g/sig-academia-training>.


### Data Center SIG

The *Data center SIG* will provide strategy and oversight for
technology sectors encompassing multiple industries and extensions in
Datacenter & Cloud Computing. This SIG will identify gaps across
industries and RISC-V groups and create TGs that will address these
gaps.

More info at <https://lists.riscv.org/g/sig-datacenter> and
<https://github.com/riscv-admin/datacenter/blob/main/CHARTER.md>.


### HPC-SIG

Special Interest Group on *High-Performance Computing* (HPC).

More info at <https://lists.riscv.org/g/sig-hpc>.


### SoC HC

The *System on Chip (SoC) infrastructure Horizontal Committee*
contains but not limited to the components that straddle the
hardware/software boundary and are necessary to boot and operate
systems in every product from IOT/embedded through Data Center/Cloud
and beyond. By their nature these components are also often matrixed
into other committees pertaining to security, RAS, platforms, etc. The
intent is to provide a robust set of specifications that product
implementer's need to be successful while minimizing duplication of
effort and fragmentation of design choices in the RISC-V community.

More info at <https://lists.riscv.org/g/soc-infra>.


### Shadow Stack and Landing Pads Task Group

The *Shadow Stack and Landing Pads for Control Flow Integrity
(SSLP-CFI)* task group will define privileged and unprivileged ISA
extensions that can be used by privileged and unprivileged programs to
protect the integrity of their control-flow. Specifically, for
protecting backward-edges we will define a shadow stack for storing
return-addresses in each privilege level. For protecting forward-edges
we will design a flexible label based landing pads approach which will
ensure that the execution adheres to the application’s Control-Flow
Graph. The design will follow the threat model compiled in CFI-SIG and
will be updated on demand.

More info at <https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-ss-lp-cfi>.


### SIG Soft-CPU

Special intersest group on soft CPU.

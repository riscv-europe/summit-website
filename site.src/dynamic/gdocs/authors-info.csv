The system utilizes the open source RISC-V simulator Spike as a golden model that can be co-emulated with the core in real time. In our experience, this enables verification at up to 50 MHz. This allows for rapid iteration of new features by testing them in a realistic environment without a previous need for unit-level verification.

Acknowledged as the ""father of DSP operating systems"", he co-founded Spectron Microsystems in 1987, whose SPOX and DSP-BIOS products became de-facto industry standards. Texas Instruments subsequently acquired Spectron in 1998, where Frankel (aka ""BIOS BOB"") was elected TI Fellow and served as the company's Chief Software Strategist. After retiring from TI, he co-founded Emmoco in 2011, whose BlueJoule IoT platform provided the impetus for an acquisition by Shelfbucks in 2015 -- where Bob worked for several years as a strategic advisor, as a platform architect, and as an embedded programmer. Bob then co-founded Bespoke IoT in 2019, where he's currently focused on delivering tailored solutions for low-power, long-range, low-cost wireless communication within high-volume IoT applications. Bob received an MS in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania, after pursuing undergraduate and graduate studies in the History and Theory of Music. He's been playing the flute/piccolo since 4th grade, and has more recently taken up the double-bass. ","The Em programming language elevates embedded firmware development to a higher-level which has historically eluded C. Originally conceived in the 2009-2010 timeframe, Em has evolved over the last decade through a series of commercial deployments in low-power, low-cost wireless IoT applications. Thanks to novel optimization techniques employed by the underlying language translator, Em programs would invariably out-perform their hand-crafted C counterparts in terms of time and (especially) space. Initial engagement with RISC-V began last year through Em support for two development boards used for edge-processing.

RISCV-V has also a specific difficulty : since the ISA is open, there is many implementations with subtle variants : specifics accelerators, special instructions, special register banks. Those variants are difficult to handle with a monolitic compiler. HybroGen is an experimental compiler designed to build application with dynamic binary code adaptations.",Thu,,5,MR07-08,Henri-Pierre-CHARLES-2,2023-06-08-Henri-Pierre-CHARLES-2,Y,Y,

With the finalization of the RISC-V Vector extension, the industry is looking for innovative solutions to accelerate AI and HPC applications. Maintaining a wide range of hand-optimized intrinsic kernels for various AI chips is costly and difficult to scale. We believe that RVV auto-vectorization is the key technique to alleviate this burden on human resources. We have evaluated the auto-vectorization performance of our LLVM-based compiler ZCC on some popular kernels, and it shows that ZCC has an 18% better dynamic instruction count performance compared to hand-optimized kernels written in RVV built-in functions. To the best of our knowledge, ZCC is the only one that can successfully auto-vectorize both inner and outer loops by fully utilizing RVV features.

Our goal is to achieve fine-grained high-reliability hardware development at a high abstraction level while balancing the trade-off between reliability, time-to-market, performance, and other important factors.",Tue,,31,MR12-13-14,Junchao-CHEN-2,2023-06-06-Junchao-CHEN-2,Y,Y,

However, the limited support for Linux-capable Full System-level simulators hampers development of the RISC-V ecosystem. We address this by validating a full system-level simulator, gXR5 (gem5-eXtensions for RISC-V), against the SiFive HiFive Unleashed SoC, to ensure performance statistics are representative of actual hardware. This work also enriches existing methodologies to validate the gXR5 simulator against hardware by proposing a systematic component-level calibration approach. The simulator error for selected SPEC CPU2017 applications reduces from 44% to 24%, just by calibrating the CPU. We show that this systematic component-level calibration approach is accurate, fast (in terms of simulation time), and generic enough to drive future validation efforts.",Wed,,4,MR07-08,Karan-PATHAK,2023-06-07-Karan-PATHAK,Y,Y,

Our approach utilizes this extensibility to automatically generate behavioral models for ETISS, based on abstract instruction set architecture (ISA) descriptions. This enables a quick adaptation of ETISS to an ISA variant, and eases the integration of our approach into existing design flows, e.g., to generate and validate custom RISC-V cores.

In these areas, it is crucial to guarantee that the probability of a critical failure stemming from a permanent hardware fault falls below a given threshold, often following the guidelines and rules of standards and regulations. In this scenario, possible solutions must combine functional safety goals with constraints related for example to the hardware and performance overhead, the flexibility, the ease of adoption. In the last decade, Self-Test Libraries (STLs) became a commonly adopted solution widely supported by semiconductor, IP and EDA companies, allowing system companies to deploy effective in-field test mechanisms able to detect a high percentage of permanent hardware faults arising during the operational phase (e.g., due to aging). This paper summarizes the latest advancements in the area of STLs for RISC-V architectures, emphasizing the advantages stemming under this perspective from the open instruction set architecture.",Tue,,26,MR12-13-14,Matteo-SONZA-REORDA,2023-06-06-Matteo-SONZA-REORDA,Y,,

Since modern ISAs do not specify timing behaviour, they are insufficient to address these channels. The temporal fence instruction was recently proposed as a RISC-V extension that clears the processor’s microarchitectural state and thus removes any timing dependence on execution history. It has been demonstrated to be extremely effective at low hardware overhead for in-order RV processors, such as CVA6 [1].

Variability makes MPSoCs very hard and expensive to certify for safety-critical systems.

Some of these include the deactivation of resources to avoid contention scenarios, synchronization of core’s partitions using ARINC-653 schedulers and long provisioning of budget times increasing deadlines.

Security and functional safety for RISC-V,Mr. Warren Chen,Paul Shan-Chyun Ku,X,,"When people talk about platform security, memory isolation is considered a key fundamental. In a RISC-V-based platform, there are a couple of mechanisms inside a hart to perform physical memory isolation, such as PMP, ePMP, sPMP, etc. They are used to control the access from the CPU itself. Other than CPU, I/O agents’ accesses are controlled by IOPMP. IOPMP is a checker with a set of ordered rules. Checking an access can be time-consuming because the check may not finish in one cycle, and sometimes more than one access is needed for one check. This creates a problem for latency-sensitive systems. This document will introduce two features to mitigate this problem, which were discussed in the RISC-V IOPMP Task Group. We will first introduce the latency reduction in respect of the downstream devices of an IOPMP, and then we will discuss the cooperation between IOPMP and its upstream prefetcher.",Tue,Missing Bio,17,MR05-06,Warren-CHEN,2023-06-06-Warren-CHEN,Y,Y,

<h4 id="dr-yungang-bao-risc-v-in-china-embracing-the-era-of-open-source-chip">Dr Yungang Bao â RISC-V in China: Embracing the Era of Open-Source Chip</h4>
<p><a href="http://acs.ict.ac.cn/baoyg/">Dr Yungang Bao</a> â Secretary-General, <a href="http://crva.ict.ac.cn">China RISC-V Alliance (CRVA)</a>, Chief Scientist, <a href="https://www.bosc.ac.cn">Beijing Institute of Open-Source Chip (BOSC)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>RISC-V has made a significant impact on the chip industry and academia all over the world. Chinaâs RISC-V community shares the same goals of building a shared global RISC-V ecosystem and has been one of the main contributors to the RISC-V ecosystem. In this talk, I will first summarize the status of RISC-V in China and then introduce two specific projects towards building an open-source chip ecosystem: (1) The XiangShan project targets an open-source high-performance RISC-V core (https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan); (2) The One Student One Chip (OSOC) Initiative aims to train undergraduates by building real RISC-V chips and has already attracted about 3000 participants from 300+ universities.</p>
<p><em>Bio</em></p>
<p><em>Yungang Bao is a professor of Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and is the deputy director of ICT, CAS.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Todayâs data-parallel workloads in HPC, AI, IoT demand ever-growing performance under an (almost) constant power envelope. To address this fundamental challenge in a regime of diminishing returns from technology scaling, we must minimize overhead associated with data transfer, data-flow management, as well as instruction fetching, decoding, while introducing âcontrolled dosesâ of domain specialization. The last decade has seen the rise of open instruction sets, open architectures, and open hardware as key enablers for designing more efficient computing systems. In this talk, I share insights gained in a decade of design adventures on open-source RISC-V hardware and software for energy-efficient computing, moving from tiny, parallel ultra-low power chips to high-performance many-core chiplets, and provide a personal view on future directions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The ongoing development and maturation of RISC-V LLVM support has been a major success story for RISC-V software ecosystem enablement through cross-party collaboration. This talk will bring you up to date on the current status of that effort (both for scalar and vector instruction set extensions), highlighting some of the more interesting challenges along the way. Looking to the future, weâll explore how the nature of LLVM development for RISC-V is changing as support for the standard ratified extensions matures, more hardware reaches the market, and as RISC-V support is added for additional LLVM project tools and sub-projects beyond the backend and the Clang C/C++ frontend.</p>

<p>PhD Thierry Collette â Director, Information Sciences and Techniques Research Group, <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com">Thales Research &amp; Technology France</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Thales has identified RISC-V as a great opportunity to master the performance, safety, security and certification of its solutions and has decided to actively contribute to these open source initiatives at different levels. After 4 years of Thales involvement, the opportunities of this technology are more important, the industrial ecosystem is being built and already products are being designed that take into account the use of RISC-V. Thalesâ involvement in the OpenHW Group has collectively enabled the emergence of the CVA6 processor. Nevertheless, we must continue to meet the other challenges linked to this adventure, and thanks to the support of the European public authorities, we will be able to develop the ecosystem to integrate these new components into products more quickly. Finally, the new freedom to refine processor architectures offers new opportunities to address our future applications.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickpype/">Patrick Pype</a> â Director Strategic Partnerships, NXP Semiconductors.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>TRISTAN is a European KDT cooperation project which started in December 2022 and runs for 3 years. The overarching aim is to expand, mature and industrialize the European RISC-V ecosystem so that it is able to compete with existing commercial alternatives. This will be achieved by leveraging the Open-Source community to gain in productivity and quality. This goal will be achieved by defining a European strategy for RISC-V based designs including the creation of a repository of industrial quality building blocks to be used for SoC designs in different application domains (e.g.Â automotive, industrial, etc.). The TRISTAN approach is holistic, covering both electronic design automation tools (EDA) and the full software stack. The TRISTAN consortium is composed of 46 partners from industry (both large industries as well as SMEs), research organizations, universities and RISC-V related industry associations, originating from Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Turkey and Switzerland. The presentation will focus on some of the specific targets and expected results of the project and how this fits in the Europen RISC-V Open-Source Roadmap which was developed by a European Working Group and is documented in a report: <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/recommendations-and-roadmap-european-sovereignty-open-source-hardware-software-and-risc-v">``Recommendations and roadmap for European sovereignty on open source hardware, software and RISC-V Technologies | Shaping Europeâs digital futureââ</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>OpenTitan brought a new level of transparency to secure silicon development with its first discrete chip design, freely available today. However, OpenTitan has always had broader goals than a single discrete silicon root of trust.</p>
<p>This talk will discuss the entire OpenTitan family of permissively licensed design and verification IP in the broader context of creating a high quality open silicon ecosystem. I will review the current state of the project, both the upcoming commercial discrete device tapeout and forthcoming designs built from the OpenTitan IP ecosystem.</p>
<p>I will explore our unique Silicon Commons approach to development across diverse partners and geographies, including how our governance model â hosted by the non-profit engineering firm, lowRISC C.I.C. â created a stable community development platform. Finally, I will present how our commitment to open development led to commercial and research innovations today, concretely demonstrating the value of implementation and development transparency</p>

<h4 id="roland-weigand-risc-v-a-shooting-star-in-space">Roland Weigand â RISC-V: a Shooting Star in Space</h4>
<p>Roland Weigand â <a href="https://www.esa.int">European Space Agency (ESA)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The European Space Agency, in a long tradition, is promoting the use of open Instruction Set Architectures (ISA). The SPARC ISA had been selected more than 25 years ago, mainly for two reasons: Firstly, because it is an open specification, warranting our non-dependence by allowing us to develop our own IP, avoiding court cases with a copyright owner. Secondly because of its significant backing from the commercial world, ensuring availability of compilers etc. Several generations of SPARC microprocessors have been developed for space, many thousands of parts used on satellites and rockets. Today, SPARC is obsolete in academia and in the commercial world, there are no more young developers coming from universities, maintaining SW tools and OS is becoming a burden for our small space community.</p>
<p>RISC-V is an open ISA, like SPARC, but thanks to the rapidly growing developer community, active standardization, a wide choice of IP providers and its scalability, it is the preferred choice to replace SPARC in space. While the existing microprocessors continue to be supported by their suppliers, ESA recommends the space community to standardize on RISC-V across the full range of applications, from microcontroller to High Performance Computing (HPC).</p>
<p>The talk will introduce the efforts introducing RISC-V to space and highlight some of the challenges encountered when developing microprocessors for space. Radiation effects and reliability requirements must be considered, but constraints exist also on the organisational and commercial side, space being a niche market with a small developer community and long product life cycles.</p>

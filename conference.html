<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Today’s data-parallel workloads in HPC, AI, IoT demand ever-growing performance under an (almost) constant power envelope. To address this fundamental challenge in a regime of diminishing returns from technology scaling, we must minimize overhead associated with data transfer, data-flow management, as well as instruction fetching, decoding, while introducing “controlled doses” of domain specialization. The last decade has seen the rise of open instruction sets, open architectures, and open hardware as key enablers for designing more efficient computing systems. In this talk, I share insights gained in a decade of design adventures on open-source RISC-V hardware and software for energy-efficient computing, moving from tiny, parallel ultra-low power chips to high-performance many-core chiplets, and provide a personal view on future directions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickpype/">Patrick Pype</a> – Director Strategic Partnerships, NXP Semiconductors.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>TRISTAN is a European KDT cooperation project which started in December 2022 and runs for 3 years. The overarching aim is to expand, mature and industrialize the European RISC-V ecosystem so that it is able to compete with existing commercial alternatives. This will be achieved by leveraging the Open-Source community to gain in productivity and quality. This goal will be achieved by defining a European strategy for RISC-V based designs including the creation of a repository of industrial quality building blocks to be used for SoC designs in different application domains (e.g. automotive, industrial, etc.). The TRISTAN approach is holistic, covering both electronic design automation tools (EDA) and the full software stack. The TRISTAN consortium is composed of 46 partners from industry (both large industries as well as SMEs), research organizations, universities and RISC-V related industry associations, originating from Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Turkey and Switzerland. The presentation will focus on some of the specific targets and expected results of the project and how this fits in the Europen RISC-V Open-Source Roadmap which was developed by a European Working Group and is documented in a report: <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/recommendations-and-roadmap-european-sovereignty-open-source-hardware-software-and-risc-v">``Recommendations and roadmap for European sovereignty on open source hardware, software and RISC-V Technologies | Shaping Europe’s digital future’’</a>)</p>

<p>Roland Weigand – <a href="https://www.esa.int">European Space Agency (ESA)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The European Space Agency, in a long tradition, is promoting the use of open Instruction Set Architectures (ISA). The SPARC ISA had been selected more than 25 years ago, mainly for two reasons: Firstly, because it is an open specification, warranting our non-dependence by allowing us to develop our own IP, avoiding court cases with a copyright owner. Secondly because of its significant backing from the commercial world, ensuring availability of compilers etc. Several generations of SPARC microprocessors have been developed for space, many thousands of parts used on satellites and rockets. Today, SPARC is obsolete in academia and in the commercial world, there are no more young developers coming from universities, maintaining SW tools and OS is becoming a burden for our small space community.</p>
<p>RISC-V is an open ISA, like SPARC, but thanks to the rapidly growing developer community, active standardization, a wide choice of IP providers and its scalability, it is the preferred choice to replace SPARC in space. While the existing microprocessors continue to be supported by their suppliers, ESA recommends the space community to standardize on RISC-V across the full range of applications, from microcontroller to High Performance Computing (HPC).</p>
<p>The talk will introduce the efforts introducing RISC-V to space and highlight some of the challenges encountered when developing microprocessors for space. Radiation effects and reliability requirements must be considered, but constraints exist also on the organisational and commercial side, space being a niche market with a small developer community and long product life cycles.</p>

<p><em>Graduated 1993 in Electrical Engineering and Semiconductor Physics from Ecole Supérieure d’Electricité (“Supélec”) in Paris / France. Worked as digital ASIC designer for Infineon in Munich and Tel Aviv in various consumer electronics projects (e.g. TV frame rate converter, DSL modem) dealing with integration of embedded DRAM and DSP cores. Joined the European Space Agency (ESA) in 2000 as a Microelectronics Engineer. In charge of various IC development projects, a predominant topic are standard microprocessors and SoC’s built around microprocessor cores, as well as radiation-hard design methodology.</em></p>

<h4 id="franck-bernard-the-risc-v-opportunity-in-automotive-electronics">Franck Bernard – The RISC-V opportunity in Automotive Electronics</h4>
<p>Franck Bernard, Bosch.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>A digital transformation of the car is currently taking place, driven by powertrain electrification, increased levels of autonomy, new in-car experiences and the trend towards the Software-defined vehicle. The automotive supply chain is looking for the computing architectures that can deliver this future.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will examine the opportunity that Bosch sees in the RISC-V ISA and how it can be applied to future automotive challenges. We will detail architectural trends and the move from distributed to domain-centralized and then vehicle-centralized compute. The processing needs of the different in-car processing modules will be discussed, including performance requirements and the range of cores that will be required.</p>
<p>We will discuss the benefits that the RISC-V architecture can bring to Bosch as an automotive supplier and how Bosch is engaging with the RISC-V ecosystem to address its computing needs across both hardware and software, as well as key considerations such as Functional Safety and Security, in both the short and long term.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Today’s data-parallel workloads in HPC, AI, IoT demand ever-growing performance under an (almost) constant power envelope. To address this fundamental challenge in a regime of diminishing returns from technology scaling, we must minimize overhead associated with data transfer, data-flow management, as well as instruction fetching, decoding, while introducing “controlled doses” of domain specialization. The last decade has seen the rise of open instruction sets, open architectures, and open hardware as key enablers for designing more efficient computing systems. In this talk, I share insights gained in a decade of design adventures on open-source RISC-V hardware and software for energy-efficient computing, moving from tiny, parallel ultra-low power chips to high-performance many-core chiplets, and provide a personal view on future directions.</p>

<p><a href="https://asbradbury.org">Alex Bradbury</a> – Compiler Engineer <a href="https://www.igalia.com">Igalia</a> (Spain, UK).</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The ongoing development and maturation of RISC-V LLVM support has been a major success story for RISC-V software ecosystem enablement through cross-party collaboration. This talk will bring you up to date on the current status of that effort (both for scalar and vector instruction set extensions), highlighting some of the more interesting challenges along the way. Looking to the future, we’ll explore how the nature of LLVM development for RISC-V is changing as support for the standard ratified extensions matures, more hardware reaches the market, and as RISC-V support is added for additional LLVM project tools and sub-projects beyond the backend and the Clang C/C++ frontend.</p>

<h4 id="brett-cline-risc-v-customization-hwsw-co-optimization-and-custom-compute">Brett Cline – RISC-V customization, HW/SW co-optimization, and custom compute</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brett-cline/">Brett Cline</a> – CCO, <a href="https://codasip.com/">Codasip</a></p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>If you optimize your software for a general-purpose core there is a substantial risk that your algorithms are executed inefficiently and therefore run slowly. You can address this by creating fixed-function circuits designed to perform a specific set of operations. These hardware functions can be extremely fast, but because they are hard coded, it is difficult to modify or update them. So how can you achieve flexibility and performance? By combining both approaches. A key benefit of RISC-V customization is that you can create custom instructions tailored to your specific application needs. To pick custom instructions correctly and create efficient implementations, software and hardware teams need to collaborate. By starting work earlier on processor customization, the software team can start developing their critical algorithms and uncover much sooner those potential gains that could not be achieved if the hardware was already frozen.  We call this Custom Compute, and its benefits extend beyond performance and energy efficiency. Custom Compute can also enable organizations to improve security by adding security features at the heart of the processor. A closer collaboration between hardware and software teams, supported by a strong methodology and by efficient tools, is the future standard of system design.</p>

<p>PhD Thierry Collette – Director, Information Sciences and Techniques Research Group, <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com">Thales Research &amp; Technology France</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Thales has identified RISC-V as a great opportunity to master the performance, safety, security and certification of its solutions and has decided to actively contribute to these open source initiatives at different levels. After 4 years of Thales involvement, the opportunities of this technology are more important, the industrial ecosystem is being built and already products are being designed that take into account the use of RISC-V. Thales’ involvement in the OpenHW Group has collectively enabled the emergence of the CVA6 processor. Nevertheless, we must continue to meet the other challenges linked to this adventure, and thanks to the support of the European public authorities, we will be able to develop the ecosystem to integrate these new components into products more quickly. Finally, the new freedom to refine processor architectures offers new opportunities to address our future applications.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgielda/">Michael Gielda</a> – Co-Founder and VP Business Development, <a href="https://antmicro.com/">Antmicro</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>RISC-V offers unprecedented freedom in designing hardware systems, prompting a renaissance in new core implementations, system building blocks and SW-HW co-design paradigms. Drawing on the experience of working with the expansive landscape of RISC-V implementations, both on the hardware and software level, Antmicro is developing a visual platform designer which helps navigate this complexity. The tool builds on the configurability of RISC-V and the our vast open source database of hardware components to let you create advanced, real-world systems which can be simulated with the open source Renode simulator and seeded with software such as Zephyr or Linux.</p>
<p>Thanks to Renode’s support for vector and custom instructions and integration with Google’s IREE toolchain through Antmicro’s Kenning ML framework, the designer is also a great entrypoint for hardware-accelerated ML co-design, and combined with Antmicro’s photorealistic 3D component model library and open source HW design methodology it can be used to kickstart the development of custom RISC-V based devices.</p>
<p>Combine cores and HW peripherals, SoCs, modules and other hardware components, all the way to heterogeneous connected systems to build, simulate and develop software for any kind of RISC-V platform. The transparency and flexibility of this comprehensive design paradigm will provide infinite possibilities for collecting both hardware and software data for efficient co-design</p>

<p>Building a modern, complex, RISC-V based digital design like the Caliptra Root of Trust requires collaborative effort between multiple development teams of various backgrounds, especially in standards-based multi-organization environments like CHIPS Alliance. While in software development massive, standards-driven collaboration is a reality through open source infrastructure and tools, the digital design space often lacks the open source tooling needed to easily share and automate workflows, scale continuous integration and enable security through transparency of the development process. In this paper, we will describe how digital design tools and workflows developed by CHIPS Alliance are being used in practice in a collaborative environment as a potential template for other work in this space.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>TRISTAN is a European KDT cooperation project which started in December 2022 and runs for 3 years. The overarching aim is to expand, mature and industrialize the European RISC-V ecosystem so that it is able to compete with existing commercial alternatives. This will be achieved by leveraging the Open-Source community to gain in productivity and quality. This goal will be achieved by defining a European strategy for RISC-V based designs including the creation of a repository of industrial quality building blocks to be used for SoC designs in different application domains (e.g. automotive, industrial, etc.). The TRISTAN approach is holistic, covering both electronic design automation tools (EDA) and the full software stack. The TRISTAN consortium is composed of 46 partners from industry (both large industries as well as SMEs), research organizations, universities and RISC-V related industry associations, originating from Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Turkey and Switzerland. The presentation will focus on some of the specific targets and expected results of the project and how this fits in the Europen RISC-V Open-Source Roadmap which was developed by a European Working Group and is documented in a report: <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/recommendations-and-roadmap-european-sovereignty-open-source-hardware-software-and-risc-v">``Recommendations and roadmap for European sovereignty on open source hardware, software and RISC-V Technologies | Shaping Europe’s digital future’’</a>)</p>

<h4 id="roland-weigand-risc-v-a-rising-star-in-space">Roland Weigand – RISC-V: a Rising Star in Space</h4>
<p>Roland Weigand – <a href="https://www.esa.int">European Space Agency (ESA)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The European Space Agency, in a long tradition, is promoting the use of open Instruction Set Architectures (ISA). The SPARC ISA had been selected more than 25 years ago, mainly for two reasons: Firstly, because it is an open specification, warranting our non-dependence by allowing us to develop our own IP, avoiding court cases with a copyright owner. Secondly because of its significant backing from the commercial world, ensuring availability of compilers etc. Several generations of SPARC microprocessors have been developed for space, many thousands of parts used on satellites and rockets. Today, SPARC is obsolete in academia and in the commercial world, there are no more young developers coming from universities, maintaining SW tools and OS is becoming a burden for our small space community.</p>
<p>RISC-V is an open ISA, like SPARC, but thanks to the rapidly growing developer community, active standardization, a wide choice of IP providers and its scalability, it is the preferred choice to replace SPARC in space. While the existing microprocessors continue to be supported by their suppliers, ESA recommends the space community to standardize on RISC-V across the full range of applications, from microcontroller to High Performance Computing (HPC).</p>
<p>The talk will introduce the efforts introducing RISC-V to space and highlight some of the challenges encountered when developing microprocessors for space. Radiation effects and reliability requirements must be considered, but constraints exist also on the organisational and commercial side, space being a niche market with a small developer community and long product life cycles.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to their increasing computational capabilities and the open ISA’ s ability to tailor silicon to specific use cases, RISC-V based microcontroller devices are an interesting target for Machine Learning workflows in low-power applications. To make the best of the constrained resources of MCUs, Antmicro’s Kenning open source AI/ML framework was extended with a bare-metal runtime backend, enabling use with RISC-V based devices that cannot - or don’t need to - run Linux. Kenning enables you to seamlessly develop, train, optimize and deploy ML models on various embedded targets and can automatically convert the model format between the most popular AI frameworks and optimize models for their target runtime. The metrics from the deployed models can be utilized to monitor various aspects of processing, from machine resource usage to result quality.</p>
<p>To further improve the developer experience, Kenning has been integrated with Renode, Antmicro’s open source, deterministic simulation framework. The integration of Kenning and Renode enables a hardware-less development flow and allows for complete insight into model execution and AI accelerator utilization. Renode provides a fully automated, reproducible execution environment, allowing a CI-based development of embedded models, optimization libraries, and AI accelerators. The demo will present a complete ML model deployment flow based on Kenning, targeting Google’s Springbok RISC-V AI accelerator and leveraging the RISC-V Vector Extension, fully simulated in Renode.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Digital chip designers face a significant challenge when it comes to integrating the necessary analog circuitry to support their SoC designs. They can experience difficulties in obtaining appropriate analog IP for specific processes and foundries, and struggle with the integration of multiple analog IP blocks from different vendors into their systems. The integration of analog and digital at the mixed-signal boundary poses a particularly daunting and resource-intensive task, requiring specialized knowledge and tools. To address these challenges, Agile Analog present an innovative analog IP subsystem for RISC-V applications. This subsystem is designed to be customizable, and digitally wrapped, offering a novel solution that tackles many of the issues encountered by SoC designers with existing solutions. Specifically, Agile Analog’s subsystem includes a comprehensive set of analog IP components essential for a typical battery-powered IoT system, including a power management unit (PMU), a sleep management unit (SMU), and data converters. These IP components undergo thorough verification in both analog and digital environments, ensuring their reliability and performance, plus seamlessly connect to the MCU’s peripheral bus and are supplied with a SystemVerilog model, facilitating their integration into an existing SoC’s verification environment. </p>

<p>Simon Davidmann – President &amp; CEO, <a href="https://www.imperas.com/">Imperas Software Ltd.</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The design freedoms of RISC-V offer systems and SoC developers new flexibility to optimize a processor for the requirements of the target application. Now Architectural Exploration is not just about the configuration of multi-core designs, but the analysis of the application and potential advantages of custom instructions. Custom extension can boost the performance for a target class of operations, or support new multi-core communication methods. Software development with virtual prototypes is well established, but new to RISC-V is the advantage of these platforms offer to end users migrating legacy applications to the new RISC-V based device, well before silicon is available. For SoC teams optimizing a RISC-V processor they also need to address the additional challenge of RISC-V verification, open standards such as The RISC-V Verification Interface (RVVI) are helping the ecosystem support for standards-based test benches and Verification IP. This talk highlights the RISC-V models that are unifying the hardware, software, and verification teams across all phases of RISC-V projects with dependable quality and efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The semiconductor industry has benefited from shrinking process nodes to improve performance while reducing cost and power for many years. But this no longer holds. We can’t rely on smaller silicon geometries to achieve computational improvements. Instead, we are in a world where performance, power, and cost benefits must come from the architecture and from custom compute. With many possible specialized processor architectures, processor design automation is essential to ensure that design cycles are short and cost effective. In this demo, we will go through some examples that show how RISC-V designs are customized for computational workloads in different domains using a single, unified toolchain for processor design automation.</p>
